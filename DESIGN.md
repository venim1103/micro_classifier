# Micro Classifier Design

Status: Proposed design; implementation has not started.  
Research date: 2026-10-13.  
Target: STM32N6 with Neural-ART, initially an N657 development board.

This document records the feasibility findings, recommended architecture, and
validation plan for a Jev-like embedded classifier. It incorporates the final
student-distillation discussion in the user-provided Idea0.pdf, approximately
pages 163-189, and research into published Vela implementations and ST tooling.

Hardware and software constraints below are source-verified. Architecture,
memory budgets, and milestone gates are proposals, not measured results or
approved product requirements. No teacher inference, student training, ST
compiler execution, firmware build, or physical-board benchmark has been
performed for this project.

## 1. Decision Summary

Build a task-specific micro-student trained on reviewed examples and genuine
Vela decision distributions. Start with static INT8 inference and operators that
map efficiently to Neural-ART: convolution, dense layers, ReLU, and suitable
pooling. Use the Cortex-M55 for bounded preprocessing, probability calculation,
calibration, and rejection.

Do not start by compressing an existing Vela model into ternary weights or by
assuming the PDF's small transformer will execute entirely on the NPU. First
prove export, quantization, hardware mapping, and internal-memory deployment
with a minimal model. Then establish task accuracy and the benefit of
distillation before expanding functionality.

| Capability | Feasibility assessment |
| --- | --- |
| Known tasks, fixed labels, typed results and probabilities | Credible initial scope |
| Several known tasks sharing an encoder | Credible after single-task validation |
| Runtime-defined options within a bounded domain | Research extension; requires option-conditioned training |
| Arbitrary new questions, rubrics, and broad world knowledge | Not a credible first target in a few megabytes |
| Direct Vela 0.3B, 4B, or 9B execution in internal SRAM | Outside the memory budget |

Preserving an API shape is not preserving the teacher's capability. The first
version must explicitly reject unsupported task IDs, schema versions, or
options instead of implying general Vela compatibility.

## 2. Goals, Boundaries, and Open Requirements

### Goals

- Execute the deployed classifier offline on the microcontroller, without a
  hidden host-side encoder or cloud inference dependency.
- Return structured decisions and useful probability distributions without
  generating text tokens.
- Establish reproducible data, teacher labeling, training, export, firmware,
  and target validation workflows.
- Prove memory placement and end-to-end latency rather than infer them from
  parameter counts or advertised peak NPU throughput.
- Make unsupported inputs and uncertainty explicit, with application-defined
  rejection and fallback behaviour.

### Initial Non-Goals

- General-purpose language generation or reproducing all Vela functionality.
- On-device training or online weight updates.
- A new ternary runtime, a general BitNet port, or custom attention kernels.
- Treating a learned classifier as a safety-certified motor controller.
- Assuming a European-headquartered supplier proves the origin of every die,
  assembly step, or board component.

### Decisions Required Before Scaffolding

| Requirement | Current status |
| --- | --- |
| First useful classification task and ground-truth policy | Unspecified |
| Input modality: text, numeric state, or both | Unspecified |
| Languages and maximum input length | Unspecified |
| Fixed task catalogue versus runtime-defined questions | Unspecified |
| Whether external RAM is forbidden | Unspecified; internal-memory inference proposed |
| Whether external flash for boot/storage is allowed | Unspecified; separate from inference memory |
| Latency deadline, throughput, and power envelope | Unspecified |
| Required per-class recall, error costs, and rejection coverage | Unspecified |
| Board selection and any component-origin requirements | Unspecified |
| Devcontainer examples and certificate-system details | Not available in the workspace |

Robotics is a possible application discussed in the PDF, not an assumed first
project requirement. The first task should be small enough to label reliably
and important enough to make the pilot useful.

## 3. Verified Hardware and Compiler Constraints

### STM32N6

The [STM32N6 family][st-family] includes Cortex-M55 devices with Helium/MVE.
N6x7 variants include Neural-ART; N6x5 variants do not. The
[STM32N657][st-n657] offers a CPU up to 800 MHz, an NPU up to 1 GHz, and
advertised NPU performance around 600 GOPS. Peak throughput is not an
application latency guarantee.

ST advertises approximately 4.2 MB of contiguous embedded SRAM, organized in
banks. Firmware, stacks, input/output buffers, model constants, activations,
runtime objects, and compiler-generated control data compete for memory. Bank
accessibility, alignment, bandwidth, and security configuration also matter.

STM32N6 has no internal user flash. As described in ST's
[boot example][st-boot], SRAM-loaded development operation is temporary.
Standalone cold boot needs persistent storage or an external loader. Therefore:

- Internal-SRAM inference can avoid external RAM and external weight reads
  during inference.
- External flash may still store firmware and model initializers for boot.
- A debugger-loaded SRAM demo is not proof of a standalone product.
- If all external persistent storage is forbidden, the boot/loading requirement
  must be resolved separately; volatile SRAM cannot retain the application.

### Neural-ART Mapping

The [ST Edge AI Core 4.0.1 operator documentation][st-operators] describes
static input/output shapes and efficient INT8 weights plus INT8 activations.
Supported formats include tensor-oriented ONNX QDQ and fully integer TFLite.
The documented quantization scheme uses symmetric signed weights, asymmetric
signed activations, per-channel weight scales, and per-tensor activation scales.

| Operation or feature | Deployment implication |
| --- | --- |
| Quantized convolution and dense layers with constant weights | Strong initial building blocks |
| Quantized ReLU and supported pooling | Suitable subject to shape/window constraints |
| `MatMul` / `BATCH_MATMUL` | Hardware mapping requires a constant second input |
| Attention score and value products | Variable operands require software fallback, if available |
| Embedding lookup / `Gather` | Software integer mapping |
| Floating-point operations | CPU execution rather than direct NPU execution |
| Dynamic shapes or weight-only quantization | Not the intended efficient deployment path |
| ONNX importer accepts an operator | Does not establish NPU acceleration |

An unsupported hardware operator may use a CPU implementation or cause
compilation failure. Inspect the generated mapping and actual target profiling;
do not assume all fallback paths are available or inexpensive.

The compiler's pooling, broadcasting, kernel, and feature-width constraints
must inform model layout. Even supported operations can be decomposed into
multiple epochs and perform differently from their nominal operation count.

### Memory Placement and Initialization

The [Neural-ART compiler][st-compiler] provides an
`internal-memories-only--default` profile. Default profiles can permit external
flash and RAM, so default compilation does not prove the proposed constraint.

The following is documented prospective syntax, not a command already run:

```sh
stedgeai generate -m student_int8.onnx --target stm32n6 \
  --st-neural-art profile-internal-memories-only--default
```

The final application needs a memory-pool configuration and linker layout with
disjoint firmware and inference regions. Check all generated initializers and
control blobs, not only the activation allocation. The `--st-neural-art` option
is essential to select the NPU compilation path rather than M55-only code.

ST's [initializer documentation][st-initializers] makes the application
responsible for copying/loading SRAM-resident weights before inference.
Memory must be enabled and clocked before initialization. Startup loading,
cache maintenance, NPU permissions, RIF/RISAF configuration, and reserved memory
ranges are part of the design, not incidental firmware details.

Use the generated bindings and matching LL_ATON/STAI runtime from one pinned
tool delivery. Do not transplant the PDF's legacy `ai_network_run` example or
handwritten activation allocation into an NPU deployment without validating
the generated contract.

There is no documented host NPU emulator that replaces numerical validation of
the generated implementation on a physical board. The
[NPU validation project][st-projects] and AiRunner provide an appropriate
starting point. The supplied CM55 validation example assumes external-flash
weights and is not a ready-made internal-SRAM CPU comparison.

## 4. Vela Feasibility and Teacher Selection

### Direct Deployment Does Not Fit

The [Vela 0.3B configuration][vela-small-config] uses ModernBERT with 22 layers,
hidden width 768, intermediate width 1,152, 12 attention heads, and a vocabulary
of 256,008 entries.

| Calculation | Result | Limit of the estimate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Embedding parameters: 256,008 x 768 | 196,614,144 | Embedding table only |
| Embedding storage with one byte per parameter | 196.6 MB / 187.5 MiB | Excludes the rest of the model and quantization metadata |
| Dense packed ternary estimate for 307M parameters | About 60.8 MB | Ideal packing at log2(3) bits/value; excludes all overhead |
| Two-bit packing for 307M parameters | 76.75 MB | Excludes scales, activations, and runtime |
| Linear projections for 128 tokens | About 28.2 GOP | Counts multiply and add separately; excludes attention products and heads |

The ternary estimate assumes a dense representation of arbitrary ternary
values. It is not a claim that every possible sparse or entropy-coded network
has the same storage lower bound. Nevertheless, no validated compression path
has been established that brings these Vela models into the proposed SRAM
budget while retaining their behaviour.

The appropriate route is task-specific distillation into a different
architecture, not a promise of near-lossless compression of the full teacher.

### Use the Real Decision Interface

Vela's [usage documentation][vela-small-usage] and
[implementation][vela-small-code] describe schema-conditioned questions and
options. The initial teacher adapter should use the documented
`system_one(state=..., questions=...)` interface and cache named distributions.

- Preserve option identities and ordering, task/schema versions, model
  revision, and teacher settings.
- Use separate teacher and student preprocessing. Student token IDs cannot be
  passed directly to the teacher's tokenizer-dependent model inputs.
- Cache probabilities at available numerical precision rather than rounded
  presentation strings.
- Choice `confidence` is the top-two probability margin, not a calibrated
  probability of correctness.
- Additional span questions and long-input windows can require additional
  sequences; one API call is not necessarily one forward pass.
- Span outputs are predictions, not proof of a causal explanation or safety.

### Host Memory and Precision

| Teacher | Verified reference behaviour | Proposed use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vela 0.3B | Torch reference loads FP32; BF16/FP16 unsupported there | Laptop pipeline pilot and task baseline |
| Vela 4B | About 17 GB FP32 parameter memory, plus runtime allocations | Larger teacher on one 24 GB 3090 with bounded context/batch size |
| Vela 9B | About 32 GB FP32 parameter memory, plus runtime allocations | Separate memory engineering or an appropriately sized remote host |

The [4B][vela-medium-usage] and [9B][vela-large-usage] GPU paths can use BF16
backbone autocast while retaining FP32 parameters and decision components.
Autocast does not make parameter storage BF16.

The inspected [9B custom loader][vela-large-code] rejects lower parameter
loading precision, and its `device_map="auto"` moves the model to CUDA rather
than implementing standard Accelerate multi-GPU sharding. Two NVLinked 3090s do
not automatically become one pooled memory device. A workable 9B path would
need separately validated sharding, offload, modified storage precision, or
different hardware.

No plug-and-play Q8/GGUF teacher path preserving this custom interface has been
verified. Quantized teachers are possible research candidates, but must be
checked for distribution changes, ranking changes, and task errors. Do not
assume the student is unaffected by teacher quantization.

Choose the teacher using human-reviewed task performance. A larger teacher is
not automatically a better labeling source for a specific domain.

## 5. Audit of the PDF's Final Proposal

The final proposal's teacher-student direction is useful, but its illustrative
code and performance claims are not an implementation baseline.

| Finding | Consequence | Design response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Labeling code substitutes `torch.randn(..., 5)` for teacher logits | No meaningful teacher supervision | Capture real, schema-aligned Vela distributions |
| Assumes a generic CLS classifier or guessed teacher forward API | Incorrect readout and labeling contract | Start with the documented public decision interface |
| Mixes teacher and student tokenization assumptions | Token IDs do not carry the same meaning | Preprocess the original input independently for each model |
| Padding is not properly masked or handled | Predictions can depend on padding rather than content | Specify and test padding, pooling, length, and missingness behaviour |
| Representation projection is omitted from the optimizer/DDP handling | Alignment parameters do not train or synchronize correctly | Omit alignment initially; include all trainable parameters if later added |
| Fixed five-class head is described as a general decision model | It cannot score arbitrary runtime options | Advertise a bounded task catalogue; option-conditioned models are a later experiment |
| Weight size is treated as proof of deployment | Ignores activations, fallback, runtime, and layout | Require compiler reports, linker checks, and board validation |
| Transformer NPU mapping is assumed | Dynamic attention products require CPU work | Prefer CNN/MLP first; profile any transformer alternative |
| SRAM operation is equated with no external boot storage | SRAM contents disappear after power loss | Separate boot storage from inference placement |
| Softmax is equated with trustworthy confidence | Normalization does not establish calibration | Calibrate deployed outputs and evaluate rejection behaviour |
| Latency, power, training duration, and accuracy are presented as guarantees | No supporting project measurement | Treat these as unknown until measured |

For the shown width-256, three-block student with vocabulary 1,024, 64 positions,
and five output classes, the parameter count is approximately 1.894 million,
not four million. An all-INT8 raw-parameter estimate is about 1.806 MiB, but
normalization values, biases, quantization metadata, compiler layout, and
activations can add substantial memory. This calculation does not prove fit.

The PDF's 0.08-GOP estimate for a 128-token Vela 0.3B input is also inconsistent
with the approximately 28.2-GOP linear-projection calculation above. Neither
operation count can establish target latency without mapping and measurement.

## 6. Proposed Student Architecture

### Initial Data Path

```text
Text and/or typed numeric state
        |
        v
M55: validate, normalize, encode, pad, mark missing fields
        |
        v
Neural-ART: static INT8 text CNN and/or numeric MLP
        |
        v
Small task-specific decision heads -> logits
        |
        v
M55: dequantize, calibrate probabilities, apply rejection policy
        |
        v
Typed decision result -> application policy and independent interlocks
```

Start with approximately 0.25-1 million parameters and one task. Increase model
size only when learning curves and controlled comparisons demonstrate a need.
The compiled memory footprint, not the training parameter count, controls fit.

### Text Branch

Use a compact learned embedding, convolutional blocks with constant weights,
ReLU, supported pooling, and a dense head. A 1D convolution can be represented
using a singleton spatial dimension; final layout must be compiler-tested.

Compare byte-level encoding with a small domain tokenizer. Byte encoding
reduces vocabulary and firmware tokenizer complexity but increases sequence
length, especially for multilingual text. A small tokenizer reduces sequence
length but needs a matching embedded implementation and vocabulary tables.

Specify Unicode/byte handling, normalization, separators, padding IDs, maximum
length, pooling masks, and overlength policy. Do not silently truncate away a
negation or essential field. Python and firmware preprocessing need shared
golden input/output examples.

Embedding lookup can run on M55 and feed a quantized feature tensor to the NPU,
or use the compiler's software mapping. Choose based on the measured export,
memory, and preprocessing cost rather than creating a custom kernel upfront.

### Numeric Branch

Pass numeric values directly, with explicit units, bounded normalization,
missingness flags, and timestamps or ages where relevant. Use an MLP for
instantaneous state; add a bounded history only when the task needs it.

Do not encode deterministic thresholds and arithmetic as natural-language
strings unnecessarily. Range checks, stale-data detection, and hard safety
conditions belong in application logic. Reject non-finite or invalid values
before inference.

### Decision Semantics

| Output type | Model and training semantics |
| --- | --- |
| Mutually exclusive choice | Categorical logits, softmax, categorical supervision |
| Binary decision | Binary logit/sigmoid, Bernoulli supervision |
| Independent set membership | Per-label logits/sigmoid, independent binary supervision |
| Ordered score | Distribution over ordered levels with explicit level meanings |

For an ordinal score, a useful reported value is the expected level under the
predicted distribution. Do not describe it as a universal confidence score.
Do not apply one categorical softmax to labels that can be true independently.

The application-facing result should include task and schema versions, status,
selected label(s) or score, the probability distribution, and an explicit
rejection reason when applicable. A top-two margin may be exposed separately,
but must not be renamed as probability of correctness.

Export logits initially and calculate the small final softmax/sigmoid on M55.
ST's [compiler documentation][st-compiler] notes that `--expand-softmax` can
preserve the winning class while changing probabilities; full expansion is
another option but is not bit-true either. Calibrate and validate the actual
deployed output path regardless of where probability calculation runs.

### Later Option-Conditioned Extension

A runtime-option model must encode the state, question, and candidate
descriptions as model inputs and score each candidate. Merely changing JSON
around a fixed-class head does not add this capability.

Train with candidate-order permutations, appropriate masking, bounded question
and option lengths, and held-out tasks/options. Account for repeated candidate
encoding and multiple invocations in memory and latency measurements. Claim
zero-shot capability only after evaluation on genuinely unseen schemas and
options, not paraphrases of training labels.

## 7. Data and Distillation Design

Task-specific distillation into simpler networks has published support, for
example [Tang et al.][distillation-paper]. This supports the approach, not a
guarantee that a particular micro-student preserves broad teacher capabilities.

### Dataset Construction

- Define the ground-truth policy and review an evaluation set before generating
  a large teacher-labeled corpus.
- Use representative real inputs or recorded episodes alongside controlled
  synthetic examples. Random telemetry strings alone are not representative.
- Include paraphrases, negation, ambiguity, noisy or missing fields, boundary
  cases, unsupported requests, and out-of-domain inputs.
- Split by source, episode, entity, or template family before augmentation to
  prevent near-duplicate leakage across partitions.
- Keep training, development, quantization calibration, confidence calibration,
  and locked test purposes distinct. Lock test groups before model selection.
- Record dataset versions, split assignments, teacher revision, schema,
  settings, label provenance, and human corrections.

Begin with a reviewed evaluation/seed set and a manageable labeling pilot.
Hundreds or thousands of reviewed cases and a pilot of roughly 5,000-20,000
representative examples are planning ranges, not universal requirements.
Scale using learning curves and error analysis; the PDF's 150,000-example
figure is not an established minimum.

### Training Baselines and Loss

Train a supervised-only student and an otherwise comparable distilled student.
Human-reviewed labels take precedence over teacher mistakes. Teacher agreement
is a useful diagnostic, not the primary definition of correctness.

Start with temperature 1 and combine supervised task loss with distribution
matching. For categorical outputs, the distillation term is
KL(teacher distribution || student distribution). Use Bernoulli/BCE-style
objectives for binary or independent-label outputs instead of categorical KL.

If temperature-based distillation is later used, soften both distributions
consistently and use the appropriate temperature scaling of the loss. Do not
divide only student logits while leaving teacher probabilities unchanged.
The [PyTorch tutorial][pytorch-distillation] provides a reference implementation
for the standard formulation.

Use evaluation mode and no gradient tracking for the teacher. Cache labels so
student experiments do not repeatedly depend on expensive teacher inference.
Begin without hidden-state matching; if it demonstrably helps later, include
the projection parameters in the optimizer and any distributed training state.

### Quantization and Confidence

Perform static INT8 PTQ with representative calibration inputs, following
[ONNX Runtime's quantization guidance][ort-quantization] and ST's supported
scheme. Use per-channel weight quantization and standard QDQ operations.
Avoid runtime-specific fused contrib operators unless ST explicitly supports
their exported representation.

Compare floating-point and quantized errors. Introduce QAT only if PTQ fails
the task acceptance criteria. Retest padding, small logits, boundary examples,
and rare classes after quantization.

Fit confidence calibration using the quantized/deployed path and separate
held-out data. [Temperature scaling][calibration-paper] is a simple starting
point, not a guarantee of reliability under distribution shift. Evaluate
negative log-likelihood, Brier score, calibration error, and selective
error-versus-coverage curves alongside task metrics.

## 8. Deployment Budget and Validation Gates

### Proposed Initial Budgets

| Resource | Planning target |
| --- | --- |
| Compiled model constants, including metadata and biases | At most 1 MiB |
| Peak activation/scratch allocation | At most 512 KiB |
| Complete peak internal SRAM use | At most 3 MiB |
| External RAM / external model reads during inference | None for the proposed internal-memory milestone |
| Latency and energy | To be agreed from the first application's deadline and power envelope |

The total SRAM gate includes firmware-resident data/code, stacks, preprocessing,
I/O, runtime state, control blobs, initialized model data, and temporary copies.
The difference between total advertised memory and these targets is headroom,
not automatically usable contiguous space in every bank.

These targets can change only through an explicit design decision supported by
task quality and compiler evidence. They are not claims that an untrained
architecture already meets them.

### Acceptance Gates

| Gate | Required evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Export and mapping | Static supported graph; generated reports identify all CPU fallback |
| Internal-memory placement | No external inference pools; compiler allocation agrees with linker reservations |
| Complete memory fit | Peak application memory, stack use, and temporary buffers meet the agreed budget |
| Numerical parity | Golden preprocessing and outputs compared across float host, INT8 host, and target |
| Task quality | Agreed human-ground-truth metrics and per-class/error-cost requirements on a locked test set |
| Distillation benefit | Controlled comparison against supervised-only and simpler non-neural baselines |
| Confidence and rejection | Agreed error/coverage behaviour, including ambiguous and out-of-domain inputs |
| Timing and energy | Board measurements include preprocessing, fallback, probability calculation, and I/O |
| Persistence | Cold boot loads the correct firmware and matching model initializers without a debugger |
| Robustness | Invalid inputs, stale data, unsupported schemas, timeouts, and inference failure follow application policy |

Define numerical tolerances and class-change expectations explicitly rather
than assume bit-exactness across backends. Measure latency distributions and,
where the application needs one, a defensible worst-case deadline. NPU kernel
time alone is not end-to-end decision latency.

When using a discovery board, ST's NPU validation example supports
`USE_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_DEVICES=0` for an internal-only development check.
Separately validate the intended production boot flow, including any permitted
external flash, instead of confusing development loading with cold boot.

## 9. Toolchain and Component Ownership

| Responsibility | Initial tooling or component |
| --- | --- |
| Teacher adapter | Pinned Vela release/revision and published decision interface |
| Dataset and evaluation | Versioned examples, split manifests, reviewed policy labels, metrics |
| Student training | PyTorch, single-GPU initially |
| Model export | Static standard ONNX graph with compiler-compatible operators/opset |
| Quantization | ONNX Runtime static INT8 QDQ; QAT only when needed |
| NPU generation | Pinned ST Edge AI Core / Neural-ART delivery |
| Embedded integration | STM32CubeN6 HAL/BSP, generated bindings, matching LL_ATON/STAI |
| Build and programming | Arm GNU toolchain, make/CMake as appropriate, STM32CubeProgrammer, ST-LINK |
| Target validation | ST NPU validation/AiRunner and task-specific test harness |
| Embedded API | Bounded preprocessing, decision semantics, rejection and application integration |

Keep host labeling/training/export and embedded preprocessing/runtime ownership
clear. A host HTTP wrapper can be added later, but must not perform the actual
encoder inference for an allegedly on-device classifier.

### Alternatives

- [ST Model Zoo services][st-modelzoo]: reuse relevant quantization, benchmark,
  and board bring-up patterns. It is not a turnkey Vela-to-micro NLP pipeline;
  pin a tool/runtime combination tested by the selected example.
- [CMSIS-NN][cmsis-nn]: useful M55/Helium CPU baseline and portability option;
  it does not replace Neural-ART acceleration.
- [LiteRT Micro][litert-micro]: useful small MCU interpreter; not an automatic
  N6 NPU optimizer or a way to make an oversized model fit.
- [Microsoft BitNet][bitnet]: its documented runtime is not a drop-in
  STM32N6/Neural-ART backend. Evaluate low-bit work only after INT8 succeeds.
- [ST DQNN support][st-dqnn]: documented binary/INT8 CPU configurations do not
  establish arbitrary ternary NPU execution. Storage precision, arithmetic
  support, and actual mapping are separate questions.

## 10. Safety, Security, and Reproducibility

For robotics or another consequential application, keep deterministic
interlocks, watchdogs, stale-sensor checks, and motor control independent of ML.
A classifier can recommend a behaviour; its probability must not be the sole
permission to move or proof that an action is safe.

Schedule inference so it cannot block required control deadlines. Handle
invalid data, missing data, model/runtime mismatches, low confidence, timeout,
and inference errors explicitly. A neural model's low-confidence threshold is
not a complete out-of-domain detector; test rejection against realistic unknown
inputs and add explicit domain checks where available.

Pin and inspect Hugging Face custom code before using `trust_remote_code`.
Prefer safe tensor serialization where supported, and record model, tokenizer,
schema, and compiled-artifact hashes. Firmware and memory initializers must be
distributed as a compatible versioned set.

Review model, tokenizer, dataset, generated-label, remote API, and ST tool
licenses separately. The Vela 0.3B card identifies Apache-2.0 model/code terms
and additional tokenizer terms; do not treat every associated asset as having
one license. Privacy requirements also determine whether remote teacher
labeling is permissible.

Do not claim a wholly European supply chain from the processor vendor's
headquarters. If component origin becomes a requirement, verify the BOM,
fabrication, assembly, memory, debug hardware, and other relevant components.

## 11. Development Container Direction

No devcontainer examples are present in the workspace, so their existing
certificate implementation has not been inspected or reproduced. Preserve the
requested basic structure and certificate trust system once the examples are
provided; do not replace them with guessed configuration.

The proposed environment should support:

- Reproducible ML dependencies and embedded build tools, with separate teacher
  and student/export environments if framework requirements conflict.
- An optional CUDA host profile. GPU access depends on the host NVIDIA driver
  and container toolkit, not installing a host driver inside the image.
- Persistent caches for downloaded models, datasets, and generated artifacts.
- Pinned ST tools and matching runtime/SDK versions, installed or mounted under
  their license terms rather than assuming unrestricted redistribution.
- Explicit, least-privilege device access for ST-LINK and serial validation.
- System CA trust plus the appropriate Python/Requests, package-manager, Git,
  and proxy trust configuration. Never disable TLS verification to bypass a
  certificate problem.

No container configuration, GPU job, dependency installation, or firmware
flashing is part of this research/documentation milestone.

## 12. Implementation Milestones

| Milestone | Deliverable | Exit condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M0: Scope | First task contract, constraints, labels, rejection policy, board | Open product decisions resolved for the pilot |
| M1: Deployment proof | Minimal CNN/MLP export, INT8 QDQ, NPU generation, board smoke test | Mapping and complete memory fit proven; target output comparison recorded |
| M2: Task-quality proof | Reviewed evaluation set, representative pilot data, supervised baseline | Bounded task has measurable value against simpler alternatives |
| M3: Distillation proof | Genuine cached teacher distributions and controlled student comparison | Teacher supervision improves the chosen task or has a documented reason to retain it |
| M4: Quantized validation | PTQ/QAT decision, target parity, calibration and locked test | Agreed quality, rejection, memory, timing, and energy gates met |
| M5: Application integration | Typed API, boot loading, error handling, application policy | Cold boot and application-level robustness verified |
| M6: Optional expansion | More tasks or bounded runtime-option scoring | New capabilities independently meet the same gates |

Use an untrained model and synthetic tensors only for export, mapping, and
timing smoke tests in M1; they say nothing about classification accuracy.
Do not commit to a large labeling job before this deployment proof.

The [NUCLEO-N657X0-Q][st-nucleo] is a suitable compact classifier prototype;
the [STM32N6570-DK][st-dk] is useful when camera integration is needed.
The discovery kit includes external flash and PSRAM, so verify that examples
are not silently relying on them during the internal-memory milestone.

Stop or revisit the design if a simpler rules-based model already solves the
task, the small student cannot meet reviewed task quality, or required CPU
fallback makes the agreed latency/memory budget unattainable. Move to a larger
target or revise the capability requirement explicitly rather than relabel an
off-device dependency as microcontroller inference.

## 13. Evidence and Limitations

Primary evidence consists of ST hardware/tool documentation and published Vela
model cards, configurations, and custom source. General distillation and
calibration references support methods rather than predict this project's
performance. The PDF is a source of requirements and hypotheses, not benchmark
evidence.

Research is dated 2026-10-13. Some upstream URLs follow mutable `main` branches;
pin tested revisions and tool deliveries during implementation. No compiler
report, hardware timing, energy measurement, training result, calibration result,
or supply-chain audit currently exists for this project.
