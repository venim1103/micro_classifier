# Research Review: Jev-like Classifier on STM32N6

Status: Independent review of [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) and the repository state.
Review date: 2026-10-13. Update 2 (2026-10-14, §12) covers the robot
decision-module clarification and an external AI analysis; it corrects F1, F2,
and §7.2 in place. Update 3 (2026-10-19, §70) is a whole-repository code,
design and process review. Section 71 records the subsequent independent code
repairs; product decisions remain deferred.
Scope: feasibility, verification of design claims, landscape changes, design
gaps, alternatives, risks, and concrete next steps.

Method:

- Read DESIGN.md, README.md, and the `.devcontainer` setup.
- Re-checked hardware and compiler claims against ST Edge AI Core 4.0.1
  documentation, ST product pages, and ST example projects.
- Re-checked teacher claims against Hugging Face model cards, usage documents,
  configurations, and the published custom model source.
- Established what "Jev" is from TypeSafe's documentation, API reference, and
  customer agreement.
- Surveyed recent open "Jev-style" models, tiny-NLP research, and published
  STM32N6 measurements.
- Ran local arithmetic and an ONNX export/INT8 QDQ check inside the devcontainer.
- After the review, with your approval, implemented and measured an INT8 Vela
  2.0 9B teacher loader on the devcontainer's 12 GB GPU (F2).

Not done, and why:

- No NPU compilation: ST Edge AI Core is not installed (`/opt/st-tools` is empty).
- No board measurement: no hardware attached.
- Teachers other than the INT8 Vela 2.0 9B were not executed: Vela and Decision
  models require `trust_remote_code`, i.e. running third-party Python, which
  needs code review and your approval per release.
- The PDF (Idea0.pdf) is not in the workspace, so PDF-derived statements in the
  design could not be rechecked against their source.

Estimates in this document are labelled as estimates. Everything else is cited.

## Recovery and Document Layout (2026-11-09)

Following the user's reported crash, the live review was a 262,527-byte exact
prefix of checkpoint `c226192`; the test file preserved a 7,223-byte local
selection-retention insertion followed by a truncated checkpoint prefix. The
source edit was complete. Preserved all five live context/source files under
`.git/recovery-20261109-PmbQpU/`, then mechanically appended only verified missing
checkpoint tails. The local source and test edits remain uncommitted; syntax
compilation passed. No interrupted experiment result or full gate is inferred.

Current read-only observations: 16 GiB available memory, no swap in use; the
current container reports zero OOM/OOM-kill events and a peak of 5,403,422,720
bytes. These counters do not cover a previous container or establish the crash
cause. Workspace storage is 21 MiB, the user cache 65 MiB, Git 132 MiB; disk has
328 GiB free. No cache, setting, security control or user file was deleted.

Lossless reorganization: the former 13,046-line design is a 111-line reading map
plus 16 topic chapters; the former 18,389-line review is a short recent-checkpoint
view plus nine numbered archives. Every original section and bibliography
definition is retained. Relative links are rebased, historical heading aliases
preserved, and pre-existing conflicting reference definitions retain Markdown's
first-definition behavior. This reduces routine context reads; it is not proof
that document size caused OOM or that crashes are fixed.

Validation: the first local-only migration dry run rejected a pre-existing
conflicting reference label without changing project documents. After preserving
all definitions, the dry run and written-layout check passed: 30 Markdown files,
no new broken local target/anchor; one existing unresolved target is unchanged.
Section allocation conservation and whitespace checks passed. No code suite was
rerun for this documentation change. Recovery snapshots, complete pre-migration
documents and the migration/check utility remain in the local recovery directory.

After the split, editor reads still showed pre-migration review text while
terminal reads showed the written layout. Validation therefore uses the on-disk
files; a stale editor buffer must not overwrite the recovered layout. This
discrepancy is recorded without claiming it explains the original interruption.

Next: verify the interrupted selection-retention increment with its original
finite fixture limits, counting the interruption rather than assuming success.
All qualification/admission flags remain false. Future checkpoints belong here
briefly, with whole older sections moved through the reading map rather than
repeated historical handoffs.

## 346. Supplied Captured-Interval Division Residuals (2026-11-13)

Begin clean pushed09eea2c. RoverEnv.step computes seconds=dt/planned_segments;
existing receipt words and integration input joins retain that native interval.
The receipt chain checks its native float quotient words, not an unrounded
division residual. Add a separate bounded supplied duration/count/interval
comparison using the existing rational arithmetic helper, not a floor report
or repeated integration stage. Observed builtin planned_segments1..128 is the
consumed divisor, not a recomputed or qualified segment-selection prediction.
Canonical duration is finite/positive per existing Config; raw nonfinite
observed interval is explicit unknown with supplied words preserved. No
rounding/error/timing/source/physical/execution/admission law; eight flags false.

Fresh24/60s, necessary repair24/60s reserve, root/360s. First24 PASS4.03s/
4769 deselected, no repair; <=2 canonical decodes/3 rational values/one division/
one subtraction and existing4096-bit cap. One actual control consumes the
existing captured receipt without another step/capture; independent Fraction
cases cover divisible/nondivisible intervals, signed residual/zero/subnormal/
extreme values, raw unknown output and canonical/domain/permission/work limits.
Root PASS5716, known QDQ1 xfail/77 warnings173.83s; root Ruff/changed format/
whitespace/four hashes, every prior module/function/control/decorator AST and
scoped references PASS. Both executed positions spent; unused repair is not
authority. Ignored `.git/returns-346-*` logs/hashes retained; no replay/draw/
trig/clock/geometry, protected study/model/dependency/download/hardware/native/
Arm or additional opt-in work. Next separately default-off closed current
receipt interval reports; native segment-selection intermediates, uniform
motion error and qualified duration/clocks remain independent obligations.

## 347. Intact Motion-Word Contract Relocation (2026-11-13)

Begin clean pushedce71cf6. Chapter01 grew to2578 lines after bounded current
motion-update work; move its four complete supplied speed/clipping/interval
and current receipt-composition contracts into existing chapter04. Preserve
byte-exact bodies/headings, flags, work limits and checkpoint wording.
Four old chapter01 anchors remain reading links; four checkpoint labels copy
with unchanged relative targets, and DESIGN's short map gains a direct topic
link. A separate-topic wrapper explicitly adopts no NF1 certificate premises
or historical study/run authority; no accepted requirement changes.

One fresh mechanical migration/30s PASS, no failure/repair: exact whole block/
prior headings, nine new scoped references/anchors, whitespace and four
green-tested source hashes PASS. Chapter01 now2520/chapter04 2470, around
the existing organization target; no green code/native/Arm/sanitizer rerun.
Local before snapshots and bounded bulk migration utility retained in session
files; committed documents remain portable. Next archive whole336-340 before
further root review growth, then closed current receipt interval reports.

## 348. Intact Reviewed Goal-Expression Checkpoint Archival (2026-11-13)

Begin clean pushed0d81f0b. Move complete336-340 to
[their archive][chapter-review-32] before more review growth. Preserve exact
bodies/headings/separators, failures, approvals, spent attempts and historical
next actions. In particular§336's recovered pytest footer remains distinct
from§335's spent/aborted command chain; archive relocation rewrites neither
evidence nor the user's later fresh continuation. Five old root anchors remain;
four chapter03 references rebase, and section338's326-330 archive label copies
relative to the new archive. No old limits or authority are renewed.

One fresh mechanical migration/30s PASS, no failure/repair; whole block/prior
headings, eleven scoped link/anchor targets, whitespace and all four tested
source hashes PASS. Root851 lines before this note/archive149. Local before
snapshots and bounded bulk migration utility retained in session files.
No green code/native/Arm/sanitizer rerun, studies/models/dependencies/
downloads/hardware or qualification adoption. Portable evidence remains Git
documents. Next closed current receipt interval reports with original/closing
source/report/output joins and all qualification flags false.

## 349. Closed Current Receipt Interval Reports (2026-11-13)

Begin clean pusheda0ff2de. Add independent literal default-off
include_native_interval_division to the existing current receipt reader.
It needs no motion-update inclusion: interval-only and combined reports reuse
the completed supplied helper and bind detached duration/divisor/interval
results to the current receipt digest/epoch/transition ticks/frame. Original/
closing report metadata/operand/output checks run before the final producer
sample and owner closure. Unsupported, nonfinite or changed source/report
returns explicit unknown without partial history/frame/report fields.
Default and motion-only shape/report work remain unchanged. No segment-choice/
rounding/error/source/clock/physical/execution/admission law; eight flags false.

Fresh24/60s (12 cases x interval-only/both), necessary repair24/60s reserve,
root/360s. First24 PASS4.33s/4793 deselected, no repair; original green
motion-only focused cases not rerun. <=2 interval reports/4 decodes/6 rational
values/4 arithmetic operations; original2 observations/one history check/
32 digests unchanged. Combined<=16 rational values/12 arithmetic operations
plus4 speed comparisons, with clipping family limits unchanged.
Controls cover source/closing-pose/report/metadata/layout mutations, raw
unknown output, independent inclusion, disabled/permission/type and detachment.
Root PASS5740, known QDQ1 xfail/77 warnings172.65s; root Ruff/changed format/
whitespace/four hashes, every unrelated module/function/control/decorator AST
and scoped references PASS; two resolved existing callers remain compatible.
Executed positions spent; unused repair not renewed authority. Ignored
`.git/returns-349-*` logs/hashes retained; no replay/draw/trig/clock/geometry,
protected study/model/dependency/download/hardware/native/Arm or extra opt-in
work. Next reassess remaining supported segment-selection/setup and executor
source prerequisites; uniform motion error and qualified clock/one-use/
physical/admission acceptance remain independent.

## 350. Supplied Unrounded Segment-Count Comparison (2026-11-13)

Begin clean pushed528207c. Owning step uses max(1,ceil(abs(clipped turn)*dt/
0.1)); receipts already retain clipped rate, duration and observed planned
count. A bounded scalar probe verifies native intermediate rounding can
produce quotient0x1.8000000000001p+1/count4 for supplied3.0,0.1,0.1, while
the exact quotient is3/1/reference count3. This constructed triple is outside
frozen C1's motion domain, not a new episode, accepted trajectory or uniform
claim. Initial Pylance tool request was rejected before execution for missing
workspaceRoot; the corrected one-triple/30s explicit-workspace request PASS
with /opt/venv. Keep both positions spent, without an editor-interpreter claim.

Add a separate supplied reference comparator using the existing rational
helper and one bounded integer ceiling quotient. Preserve all three raw words,
observed builtin count1..128 and reference counts above128 without trimming.
Canonical nonfinite rate is explicit unknown; finite positive duration/angle
step prevalidate. No native ceil/floor replay, missing intermediate invention,
threshold/rounding/geometry/error/source/clock/execution/admission adoption;
all eight flags false. Supplied angle step is a reference operand, not a new
Config field; actual-word control uses the existing0.1 program divisor.

Fresh24/60s, necessary repair24/60s reserve, root/360s. First24 PASS4.08s/
4817 deselected, no repair: <=3 decodes/3 rational values/2 rational operations/
one integer ceiling quotient/three scalar comparisons, existing4096-bit cap.
Independent Fraction ceilings cover original receipt operands, zero/sign/
integer boundary/noninteger/rounded-count discrepancies, reference129 versus
observed128, raw nonfinite and canonical/profile/permission/work controls.
Root PASS5764, known QDQ1 xfail/77 warnings180.11s; root Ruff/changed format/
whitespace/four hashes, every prior module/function/control/decorator AST
and scoped references PASS. Executed positions spent, unused repair not
authority; ignored `.git/returns-350-*` logs/hashes retained. No source/
controller change, protected study/model/dependency/download/hardware/native/
Arm or extra opt-in work. Next supported closed current segment-count reports,
binding existing program divisor without claiming observed intermediates;
uniform motion error/qualified clocks/physical/admission remain independent.

## 351. Closed Current Segment-Selection Reports (2026-11-13)

Begin clean pushedaad0ae8. Add independent literal default-off
include_native_segment_selection to the current receipt reader, supporting
selection-only and all combinations with motion/interval reports. No caller
source/divisor/tick/epoch override. Bind captured clipped-rate/duration/count
words to the existing0.1 program operand, explicitly labeled as a program
divisor, not a captured intermediate. Detached reports preserve current
receipt/epoch/transition/frame joins; original/closing metadata/operand/output
checks precede final producer sampling and owner closure. Changed, unsupported
or nonfinite evidence is unknown without partial fields. Old modes/default
shape/report work unchanged; no native rounding/branch/error/source/clock/
physical/execution/admission law, all eight flags false.

Fresh48/60s (12 cases x selection/motion-selection/interval-selection/all),
necessary repair48/60s reserve, root/360s. First48 PASS4.78s/4841 deselected,
no repair or unchanged-mode focused rerun. Per family <=2 reports/6 decodes/
6 rational values/4 rational operations/2 bounded integer ceilings/6 reference/
count comparisons; fixed type/profile prevalidation remains separate from
the reference bookkeeping limits, including§350's three comparisons.
Original2 observations/one history check/32 digests unchanged; all-mode<=22
rational values/16 rational arithmetic operations plus4 speed comparisons.
Controls cover source/closing-pose/report/metadata/program-word mutations,
unknown output, independent inclusion, permission/type/default-off/detachment.
Root PASS5812, known QDQ1 xfail/77 warnings174.65s; root Ruff/changed format/
whitespace/four hashes, unrelated module/function/control/decorator AST and
scoped references PASS; two resolved existing callers remain compatible.
Executed positions spent; unused repair not authority. Ignored
`.git/returns-351-*` logs/hashes retained; no source/controller change, replay/
draw/trig/native ceil/clock/geometry, protected study/model/dependency/
download/hardware/native/Arm or extra opt-in work. Next reassess the remaining
Q0-Q5 acceptance and request/guard/executor source prerequisites without
duplicating completed reports or treating matching words as qualification.

## 352. Native Integration Closing-Observation Repairs (2026-11-13)

Begin clean pushed61381bc. Q0-Q5/request reassessment found a concrete owning-code
currentness gap, not new acceptance evidence: native source samples read cache/
pose/receipt/profile words before their last observation, unlike the repaired
receipt reader. Four source/arithmetic final-pose/native-cache controls reproduce
stale successful publication:4 FAIL7.03s/4909 deselected. Move observation before
both actual native-cache and producer-word sampling. Guard actual producer and
tuple/State/frame/dynamics owner layout before indexing/asdict; malformed closing
owners are unknown, not IndexError. Existing arithmetic stages, unsupported
obligations, source acquisition, simulator/receipt/wire/controller words unchanged.

Fresh repro4/60s, required new24+affected controls <=64/60s, one necessary
repair reserve <=64/60s, root/360s. Required52 ran:50 PASS/2 FAIL3.12s/4861
deselected; both profile fixtures lacked local dataclasses.replace. Fixture-only
import repair reran only those2:PASS4.42s/4911 deselected. Green50 not repeated.
Changed format initially rejected three long new lines; existing formatter
repaired them, changed format/root Ruff/whitespace PASS. Root PASS5836, known
QDQ1 xfail/77 warnings200.90s. Four tested hashes and unrelated source/control/
decorator AST conservation PASS. Executed/rejected positions spent; no cap or
semantic assertion relaxed. Two readers keep6/12 observations,2/4 native samples,
2/4 history checks,64/160 digests; no extra probe, replay/capture/draw/trig/ceil/
clock. New controls cover final pose/cache/receipt/profile mutations and malformed
original/closing owner layouts, without partial source/arithmetic/frame output.

All eight flags false; no uniform native error, source/coverage/clock/physical/
one-use/execution/admission qualification. Existing Q0-Q5 independent acceptance,
ST/board and prospective task-quality boundaries remain missing; no studies,
models/dependencies/downloads/hardware/native/Arm opt-ins. Ignored
`.git/returns-352-*` repro/focused/repair/root/hash records retained. Next archive
whole341-345 before more root growth, then advance only a concrete supported
remaining source prerequisite; no duplicated floor/integration reports.

## 353. Intact Motion and Goal Checkpoint Archival (2026-11-13)

Begin clean pushed6b3dd84. Before further root growth, archive complete341-345
blocks/headings/separators in the existing review family, not reconstructed
summaries. Preserve five root anchors, four chapter03/04 references and the
copied relatively rebased331-335 archive label. Keep§342's failed Ruff bindings
and§345's failed/no-op profile fixture, repairs, spent positions and evidence
limits intact; relocation renews neither authority nor qualifications.
One bounded exact-content/11-target/anchor/whitespace/four-tested-hash check
PASS. Root now893 lines, archive158; no code edit or suite rerun. Three original
document snapshots and bulk utility retained in the session folder; committed
archive/links are portable, local recovery files are not. Next assess remaining
independent source/setup/coverage/error/timing acceptance and conditional
request/guard/executor dependencies; do not manufacture duplicate arithmetic
packages or turn matching words into qualified simulation operation.

## 354. Closed Live-Receipt Owned Request Joins (2026-11-13)

Begin clean pushed70edad1. Read actual Q1 source-word/motion, Q3 conditional
registration/straight-pose and Q4 owned request consumers. Their independent
acceptance remains missing, but Q0/Q4 have a supported non-arithmetic source
prerequisite: existing prepare/recheck bind owned metadata, not live producer
currentness. Add independent literal default-off include_current_receipt to
both. A shared private reader joins actual current receipt epoch/tick/frame and
closed all-false metadata. Original/closing receipt and detached output copies
close after request/capture/content work; received/retained/prepared request
mutations and changed producer/owner evidence reject without partial semantic
publication. Old defaults, schema, fixture error assumptions, UNKNOWN guard/
permission/qualification state, controller and wire/producer words unchanged.

Fresh32/60s, one necessary repair <=32/60s reserve, root/360s. First32 PASS4.27s/
4913 deselected. Preceding Ruff rejected TRY004 for ValueError on the invalid
producer type; use TypeError, already handled by public wrappers, without
rerunning green32. Inspection of opt-in indexing found original/closing owner
layout gaps: early optional tuple guard plus existing receipt closing-binding
validation. Four necessary added controls/60s PASS4.05s/4945 deselected; no prior
fixture/control expansion or unchanged successful focused rerun. Per prepare/
recheck <=2 receipt reads/4 observations/2 history checks/64 receipt digests plus
existing request work, total digest controls <=96/128; recheck keeps one default
inner preparation, not nested receipt reads. No new arithmetic/guard queries,

study/model/dependency/download/hardware/native/Arm opt-in or acceptance.
All eight flags false; matching current source and requests is not source/
coverage/native-error/registration/clock/one-use/physical/admission evidence.
Next reassess only remaining named-consumer acceptance dependencies, without
duplicating completed source/arithmetic packages or inventing a release verdict.

## 355. Checked Remaining Acceptance Blockers (2026-11-13)

Begin clean pushed1821397; the active continuation was not replaced by an old
pause or a checkpoint. After§354, check the remaining agreed queue against Q0-Q5
and actual setup, source-word/motion, history/straight-pose, native arithmetic and
owned request consumers. Available necessary source/currentness prerequisites
are implemented and verified; no further necessary non-duplicative routine
increment was identified. Further qualification/release work reaches these
concrete unsupported inputs:

- Q0 needs independently accepted actual setup/source/return/coverage provenance.
  The setup auditor checks declared geometry; current source/receipt/request
  joins check bounded correspondence, neither supplies that authority.
- Q1/Q2 need propagated source-to-wire discrepancies and independent uniform
  computed-program error/domain closure over command plus braking. Ideal motion
  requires explicit error_evidence; native word reports do not furnish it.
  Sinc argument/value, cos/sin, pi/wrapping and accumulated-motion obligations
  remain unsupported in the native arithmetic contract; no invented zero/
  sampled epsilon, duplicate arithmetic or source-scale reset follows.
- Q3 needs accepted pose/range/clock/native-transform enclosures for all retained
  prefixes/points. Current history tooling is conditional on exact-start/
  nominal-tick/stored-dt/interval-ending-twist assumptions; the isolated pose
  checker supports straight motion only. Do not narrow commands to reuse it.
- Q4 needs qualified clock/application/receipt/error lineage and serialized
  consume/admitted predecessor continuity. Current owned methods still emit
  UNKNOWN/no permission; nominal tick/expiry and matching hashes are not these
  obligations. Q5 then needs admission and separately authorized prospective D4.

No accepted packet/result/decision supplying these independent obligations is
present in the checked path. Adopting bounds/authority, protected qualification/
task studies or hardware/ST work is not routine fixture authority. Existing
compatible local checks are not blocked by missing historical accounting; all
spent/rejected/aborted positions remain intact, no green gates repeated.
Read-only tool check: stedgeai/stm32ai absent from PATH, /opt/st-tools empty;
arm-none-eabi-gcc available, no new native/Arm/hardware run. ST licences/board
readiness remain user-side; no licence/physical attachment claim was probed.

Documentation-only blocker checkpoint: scoped content/references/whitespace/
four tested hashes PASS; suite not rerun. All eight flags false, no usable
command admitted. Latest source gate remains5872/known QDQ1 xfail/77 warnings.
The next useful action needs a concrete independent Q0-Q4 claim/domain/producer/
method/result/acceptance packet or a changed authorized scope; do not manufacture
an acceptance token, duplicate diagnostics or renew exhausted protected work.
Source/artifacts and logs remain as§354; main clean and synchronized before this
checkpoint, no owned background process. This is a genuine evidence blocker,
not a request for routine planning/testing permission or a user pause.

## 356. Actual Intake Closing-Observation Repairs (2026-11-13)

Begin clean pushed706f5a3. Latest actual user request continues implementation,
not a new acceptance verdict. Reassessing Q0's actual initial-origin prerequisite
found a concrete owning intake gap overlooked by§355's no-further-prerequisite
assessment: record_environment_tick samples producer words before its closing
observation. Two default/receipt closing-pose controls reproduce stale intake:
2 FAIL4.94s/4971 deselected, DID NOT RAISE. Observe before both collected samples;
validate original/closing current tuple/State/frame layouts before indexing.
Failed reads do not publish staged source/history or undo external mutations.
No source/receipt/controller schema, native arithmetic or producer change.

Fresh repro2/60s, new24/60s (8 cases x default/receipt/integration), one necessary
repair reserve24/60s, root/360s. First24 PASS4.35s/4949 deselected; no repair or
unchanged successful focused rerun. Keep2 observations and existing receipt/
native/capture work; controls cover closing pose/action/profile/goal and malformed
original/closing owners, retained prior data and both unchanged RNG states.
No step/reset/native integration replay or additional clock. Root PASS5896,
known QDQ1 xfail/77 warnings192.87s; root Ruff/changed format/whitespace/four
tested hashes/unrelated module/function/control/decorator AST/scoped references
PASS. Executed positions spent; no bound, allowance or semantic assertion relaxed.

All eight flags false; actual source closure is not setup/source/coverage/native
error/clock/physical/one-use/admission evidence. Protected study/model/
dependency/download/hardware/native/Arm work unchanged and not executed.
Ignored `.git/returns-356-*` repro/focused/root/hash records retained. The real
continuation resumes compatible work despite missing admission evidence:
next archive whole346-350, then investigate bounded initial-tick/setup source
correspondence. Rover history retains ego/ToF/masks, not reset pose/execution;
do not mislabel that history as an actual reset receipt or invent source words.
