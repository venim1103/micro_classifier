# Research Review: Jev-like Classifier on STM32N6

Status: Independent review of [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) and the repository state.
Review date: 2026-10-13. Update 2 (2026-10-14, §12) covers the robot
decision-module clarification and an external AI analysis; it corrects F1, F2,
and §7.2 in place. Update 3 (2026-10-19, §70) is a whole-repository code,
design and process review. Section 71 records the subsequent independent code
repairs; product decisions remain deferred.
Scope: feasibility, verification of design claims, landscape changes, design
gaps, alternatives, risks, and concrete next steps.

Method:

- Read DESIGN.md, README.md, and the `.devcontainer` setup.
- Re-checked hardware and compiler claims against ST Edge AI Core 4.0.1
  documentation, ST product pages, and ST example projects.
- Re-checked teacher claims against Hugging Face model cards, usage documents,
  configurations, and the published custom model source.
- Established what "Jev" is from TypeSafe's documentation, API reference, and
  customer agreement.
- Surveyed recent open "Jev-style" models, tiny-NLP research, and published
  STM32N6 measurements.
- Ran local arithmetic and an ONNX export/INT8 QDQ check inside the devcontainer.
- After the review, with your approval, implemented and measured an INT8 Vela
  2.0 9B teacher loader on the devcontainer's 12 GB GPU (F2).

Not done, and why:

- No NPU compilation: ST Edge AI Core is not installed (`/opt/st-tools` is empty).
- No board measurement: no hardware attached.
- Teachers other than the INT8 Vela 2.0 9B were not executed: Vela and Decision
  models require `trust_remote_code`, i.e. running third-party Python, which
  needs code review and your approval per release.
- The PDF (Idea0.pdf) is not in the workspace, so PDF-derived statements in the
  design could not be rechecked against their source.

Estimates in this document are labelled as estimates. Everything else is cited.

## Recovery and Document Layout (2026-11-09)

Following the user's reported crash, the live review was a 262,527-byte exact
prefix of checkpoint `c226192`; the test file preserved a 7,223-byte local
selection-retention insertion followed by a truncated checkpoint prefix. The
source edit was complete. Preserved all five live context/source files under
`.git/recovery-20261109-PmbQpU/`, then mechanically appended only verified missing
checkpoint tails. The local source and test edits remain uncommitted; syntax
compilation passed. No interrupted experiment result or full gate is inferred.

Current read-only observations: 16 GiB available memory, no swap in use; the
current container reports zero OOM/OOM-kill events and a peak of 5,403,422,720
bytes. These counters do not cover a previous container or establish the crash
cause. Workspace storage is 21 MiB, the user cache 65 MiB, Git 132 MiB; disk has
328 GiB free. No cache, setting, security control or user file was deleted.

Lossless reorganization: the former 13,046-line design is a 111-line reading map
plus 16 topic chapters; the former 18,389-line review is a short recent-checkpoint
view plus nine numbered archives. Every original section and bibliography
definition is retained. Relative links are rebased, historical heading aliases
preserved, and pre-existing conflicting reference definitions retain Markdown's
first-definition behavior. This reduces routine context reads; it is not proof
that document size caused OOM or that crashes are fixed.

Validation: the first local-only migration dry run rejected a pre-existing
conflicting reference label without changing project documents. After preserving
all definitions, the dry run and written-layout check passed: 30 Markdown files,
no new broken local target/anchor; one existing unresolved target is unchanged.
Section allocation conservation and whitespace checks passed. No code suite was
rerun for this documentation change. Recovery snapshots, complete pre-migration
documents and the migration/check utility remain in the local recovery directory.

After the split, editor reads still showed pre-migration review text while
terminal reads showed the written layout. Validation therefore uses the on-disk
files; a stale editor buffer must not overwrite the recovered layout. This
discrepancy is recorded without claiming it explains the original interruption.

Next: verify the interrupted selection-retention increment with its original
finite fixture limits, counting the interruption rather than assuming success.
All qualification/admission flags remain false. Future checkpoints belong here
briefly, with whole older sections moved through the reading map rather than
repeated historical handoffs.

[Complete unchanged checkpoint][review-316-320-preserved-4] is preserved in the archive.

## 321. Matched Native ToF Clip/Selection Reports (2026-11-12)

Begin clean pushed6acd424. Literal default-off
`include_postprocessing_clip_selection_diagnostics` requires postprocessing
inclusion. Delivered/optional pending reports use matched retained noisy/
clipped/selected/mask/input words after independent native/companion guards.
Original/closing native/RNG/profile/pose/input/frame/history/queue/stored-word/
mask/report/output joins precede publication. Detached reports carry exact
typed source epoch/tick/delivery labels; unsupported or changed joins publish
explicit unknown without partial fields. Observed clipped operands and raw
nonfinite unknowns/zero-word ties remain unchanged, all eight flags false.

Reuse24 snapshot cases plus3 literal/dependency cases. Before execution owning
fixture inspection corrected the two-source estimate: delivered+<=2 pending,
original/closing<=6 reports,<=1158 decodes/1536 value/768 raw-word comparisons,
384 entries; independent Fraction oracle<=384 clamp comparisons. Existing
producer/RNG/geometry/clock/retention/frame/binding and addition/dropout/
selection/timing/arithmetic controls stay unchanged; combined case includes
prior reports without more producer work. No old/protected budget refund.

Fresh focused27/60s, sole necessary repair27/60s, root/360s positions.
First27 PASS6.04s with240 unselected; four hashes stable, scoped Ruff/
changed format/whitespace PASS. Root PASS5142, known QDQ1 xfail/71 warnings/
160.18s; root Ruff/changed format/whitespace and all four hashes PASS.
Both executed positions spent; repair unused, not follow-on authority.
Ignored `.git/returns-321-*`
outputs/hashes retained. Pylance before/after resolved no dynamic callers,
not static compatibility proof. No replay/extra RNG/study/model/dependency/
download/hardware/native/Arm/sanitizer opt-in or law/threshold adoption.
Value/word matches are not numerical/error/source/geometry/coverage/clock/
one-use/physical/permission/admission qualification.

Next preserve whole checkpoints311-315 before root review growth, then
independent supplied selected-float64/stored-float32 correspondence; do not
silently adopt a rounding model or normalize signed words.

## 322. Intact Retention and Delivery Checkpoint Archival (2026-11-12)

Begin clean pushedafe8848. Move whole311-315, including cloud prompt/pause,
failures, approvals, spent ledgers, bodies, headings and separators, to
[their archive][chapter-review-27]. Preserve five old root heading anchors
as archive links; rebase eight chapter02/03 references and the cloud-handoff
reading-map link. Keep historical prompt words unchanged, not fresh authority.
Copy the one required archive reference definition with its relative target.

First mechanical preflight FAILED before any write: inherited no-body-links
guard rejected section312's existing archive reference. Diagnose its one label;
sole bounded structural repair copies/rebases its definition, not the body.
Revised migration/conservation PASS, four tested source hashes unchanged;
local targets/anchors and whitespace PASS. Both positions spent, no old or
protected refund. Root726 lines before this note, archive273; no code edit,
code suite/native/Arm/sanitizer rerun, new study/model/dependency/download/
hardware action or qualification/law adoption. Local snapshots/utility retained
in session files, portable evidence in Git documents.

Next independent bounded selected-float64/stored-float32 supplied-word
correspondence. Preserve raw words/unknowns, not a rounding model or bound.

## 323. Supplied-Word Native ToF Selected/Storage Residuals (2026-11-12)

Begin clean pushed644bec6. Actual sampler captures selected float64 input and
stored float32 result of `selected.astype(np.float32)`. Standalone helper
reuses the existing sampling report's uint32-to-float32 view, not its ideal-
sampling policy. Preserve closed-history finite builtin uint32 storage
preflight and supplied canonical selected words; raw selected +/-inf reports
unknown, unsupported/NaN metadata explicitly rejects. Report exact decoded
stored-minus-supplied-selected residuals, numerical equality and decoded-word
equality separately. Do not predict stored rounding/cast words or adopt a cast
law, numerical/error bound or qualify zero-word ties. All eight flags false.

Two builtin64-word tuples; selected canonical words<=32char,64 selected decodes/
64 storage views,128 rational values/64 subtractions/64 entries,1..4096-bit
hard bound. Add24 cold-actual/exact/signed residual/zero-tie/subnormal/extreme/
raw-nonfinite/typed-word/shape/storage/rational-budget controls; independent
struct decode and Fraction oracle<=64 subtractions. Only one existing-draw
actual capture/geometry before poisoning intake/read/retain/step/reset/replay/
hash/clock/geometry paths; RNG/odometry state and inputs unchanged thereafter.

Fresh focused24/60s, sole necessary repair24/60s, required root/360s positions.
First24 PASS3.40s with all four hashes stable; root PASS5166, known QDQ1 xfail/
71 warnings/160.61s. Root/scoped Ruff, changed format/whitespace and all four
hashes PASS. Both executed positions spent; repair unused, not follow-on authority.
Ignored `.git/returns-323-*` outputs/hashes retained; no historical/protected
refund, new dependency/download/model/study/hardware/native/Arm/sanitizer opt-in.
Pointwise supplied residuals and matching words are not rounding-law/native
primitive/source/geometry/coverage/clock/one-use/physical/admission evidence.
Next separately bounded original/closing retained storage report joins.

## 324. Matched Native ToF Selected/Storage Reports (2026-11-12)

Begin clean pushed3a21002. Literal default-off
`include_postprocessing_storage_residuals` requires postprocessing inclusion.
Delivered/optional pending reports use detached matched selected/storage words
after independent native/companion guards. Original/closing native/RNG/profile/
pose/input/frame/history/queue/stored-word/mask/report/output joins precede
publication; changed/unsupported joins publish explicit unknown without partial
fields. Preserve observed residuals, typed epoch/tick/delivery labels and zero-
word ties without predicting native cast words or adopting a rounding/error
law. Raw unsupported/nonfinite source remains unknown, all eight flags false.

Reuse24 snapshot cases+3 literal/dependency controls, including changed selected
source and outgoing storage report; combined mode includes prior postprocessing
reports within unchanged producer/report caps. Original/closing<=6 reports,
384 entries/768 word decodes/768 rational values/384 subtractions; independent
struct/Fraction oracle<=192 subtractions, existing 4096-bit limit unchanged.
No replay/extra RNG/old or protected refund/new dependency/download/model/
study/hardware/native/Arm/sanitizer opt-in or safety/qualification change.

Fresh focused27/60s, sole necessary repair27/60s, required root/360s.
First27 PASS5.92s with264 unselected, all four hashes stable. Root PASS5193,
known QDQ1 xfail/71 warnings/164.24s; root/scoped Ruff, changed format/
whitespace and four hashes PASS. Both positions spent; repair reserve unused,
not follow-on authority.
Ignored `.git/returns-324-*` outputs/hashes retained. Pylance before/after
resolved no dynamic callers, not static compatibility evidence.
Source matches/residuals are not numerical/error/source/geometry/coverage/
clock/one-use/physical/permission/admission qualification.

Next reassess independently supported setup/source/coverage/error/timing
prerequisites and guarded request/executor dependencies in design§12; missing
qualification alone is not a reason to stop compatible prerequisite work.

## 325. Cold Native Goal Computation Source (2026-11-12)

Begin clean pushed0b84e02. Reassessment of design§§1/2/12 and owning code finds
native integration source/arithmetic/snapshots already present: do not duplicate
NF2 or floor reports. The actual goal producer retains a four-key final native
cache but not consumed delta/trig operands or stored float32 output. Add append-
only default-off `goal_source=None` to its cold `_record_history` operation.
Empty builtin receiver, actual owner/profile and supported finite input/word
layout preflight precede RNG/state work. Reuse existing Config validation;
no new profile/safety threshold or law. Default calculations/order/dtypes,
legacy goal keys, RNG/queues/history remain unchanged.

Copy ten vector components and five used/profile scalar values, tick/schema
metadata and eight false flags. World-goal dtype is retained, not normalized;
used position/cosine/sine include any existing odometry draws, not a law or
asserted true-yaw trig result. Computed raw nonfinite values remain explicit
unknown without correction. No new draw, clock, geometry, step, replay, study,
model, dependency, download, hardware/native/Arm/sanitizer opt-in or qualification.
Cold copies alone are not acquisition/cache/intake/retention/delivery or evidence
for numerical/primitive/geometry/coverage/clock/one-use/physical/admission bounds.

Fresh initial17/60s, sole fixture repair17/60s and root/360s positions.
First14 PASS/3 FAIL/2 retained overflow warnings5.31s: fixture indexed pending
ego despite zero-latency immediate delivery, not a producer failure. One
no-write patch context miss was diagnosed from formatted lines. Fixture repair
binds produced ego tick/current stored words; unchanged source/limits. Revised17
PASS3.65s. Before root, a bounded two-word/5s probe confirmed finite2^100 can
infer an unsupported object array and fail source status after state work.
Necessary source dtype preflight repair, not a new integer/physical bound:
materialize once before state only when opted in, reject unsupported dtype.
Revised18/60s PASS3.54s/2 warnings; all four hashes stable for each test.
Root PASS5211, known QDQ1 xfail/73 warnings165.02s (two added raw-overflow
warnings retained); root/scoped Ruff, changed format/whitespace and four
hashes PASS. Two resolved old callers before/five callers after are signature-
compatible. All five executed positions spent, no historical/protected refund;
ignored `.git/returns-325-*` outputs/hashes and probe outcome retained.
Next separately default-off actual goal acquisition/ownership pairing.

## 326. Native Goal Computation Acquisition Pairing (2026-11-12)

Begin pushed991dc62, main/upstream0/0 after fetch; Python3.12.3 at `/opt/venv`,
pytest8.4.2/Ruff0.17.0/timeout installed,365GiB free in the shared environment.
Append literal default-off `capture_native_goal_computation=False` to `step`.
Reuse the cold producer's input/profile/dtype preflight before state/RNG/clock
work, then capture one actual history production into a distinct private cache.
Retain actual RNG/odometry-RNG and legacy native-source identity, cold computation
packet, acquisition tick and nominal odometry delivery tick. Goal acquisition
is independent of fresh/held ToF; reset/default steps clear this cache. Existing
goal calculations/cache keys and public observation/info/return shape remain
unchanged. Computed raw nonfinite source remains explicit unknown, all eight
flags false; no trig/noise/cast law, clock/one-use or qualification follows.
Closed typed intake, retention and delivered/pending joins remain separate.

Fresh17/60s, sole necessary fixture repair17/60s, required root/360s positions.
Per case <=3 history calls, <=1 cold receiver, <=3 geometry calls, <=8 existing
clock reads only in combined capture; paired steps have unchanged RNG/output
words and no replay/additional draws. First8 PASS/9 FAIL/2 raw warnings8.22s:
the comparison fixture applied numerical `equal_nan` to the observation schema
string. Repair compares exact types, ndarray dtype/shape/raw bytes, scalar float
hex words and nonnumerical equality, without changing producer or limits.
Revised17 PASS/2 warnings3.65s; root PASS5228, known QDQ1 xfail/75 warnings179.91s.
Root/scoped Ruff, changed-file format, whitespace and four source hashes PASS.
Scoped AST conservation retains every other source function;43 resolved step
callers have only three intentional invalid-boolean negative-fixture diagnostics
(the prior two and this slice's new control). All three positions spent; no
historical/protected refund. Ignored `.git/returns-326-*` logs/hashes retained.
No study/model/dependency/download/hardware or native/Arm/sanitizer opt-in.
Next separately close actual goal acquisition intake with original/closing
native/RNG/profile/pose/input/tick/delivery/stored-word joins and detached output.

## 327. Closed Native Goal Computation Intake (2026-11-12)

Begin pushedfde4b22. Closed intake needs the original true pose/full Config
snapshot and Scenario identity: noisy used position cannot stand in for true
pose or establish a noise bound. Add only these bounded acquisition carrier
fields; default public outputs/calculations remain unchanged. The separate
offline sampler validates actual owner,32-character epoch, existing C1 tick
encoding and <=8 nominal odometry latency/queue/history budgets. Original and
closing cache/native/RNG/Scenario/profile/true-pose/input/tick/delivery/ego/history/
stored-word joins precede one detached supported packet. Unsupported, changed
or computed nonfinite source raises explicit ValueError without partial output;
the original raw unknown packet is retained. No replay/trig/draw/clock/geometry
or numerical/noise/cast/physical/source/clock/one-use/admission qualification.
All eight flags false. Recorder retention and publication remain separate.

World-goal inferred dtype is preserved: finite float64 canonical words or
exact signed/unsigned integer words, including integers not exactly expressible
as float64. Other observed float64 operands/native values retain signed words
as canonical strings or directly copied finite scalars;
stored float32 words use the existing uint32 view. Profile scalar types and
zero-word distinctions remain intact. The carrier adds25-or-fewer fixed Config
fields and three true-pose words, not Scenario copying or a new geometry claim.

Fresh49/60s (32 intake/17 affected acquisition), necessary repair49/60s reserve,
root/360s. First49 PASS/4 retained raw warnings3.86s, no repair. Required exact
history-limit verification adds only two fresh fixtures/60s:8 accepted,9
rejected before row iteration/copy;2 PASS/32 deselected3.60s, not another green49
run. Per intake <=2 views/1 packet copy, <=8 queue/history ego rows of4 words,
<=23 captured source words/scalars plus <=25 Config fields per view. Synthetic
repeated rows test a work limit only, not source history/coverage. Root PASS5262,
known QDQ1 xfail/77 warnings168.02s; root/scoped Ruff, changed format/whitespace,
four hashes and old source/test/decorator AST conservation PASS. All three
executed positions spent; unused repair reserve is not an execution or refund.
Ignored `.git/returns-327-*` logs/hashes retained. No protected/native/Arm work.
Next separately typed bounded goal history, then default-off recorder retention
and matched delivery with original/closing joins; no permission/admission.

## 328. Intact Goal-Prerequisite Review Archival (2026-11-12)

Begin clean pusheda8dc8e6. Before further review growth, move whole316-320
checkpoints to [their archive][chapter-review-28]: bodies, headings, separators,
failures, spent/unused ledgers and historical limits remain byte-exact. Preserve
all five old root anchors as archive links; rebase four chapter03 report links
and copy the existing306-310 archive reference relative to its new location.
Update only the root reading map and short current state; no requirements,
source, control, authority or qualification changes.

One finite preflight/apply/verify position PASS, no failure/repair. Exact archive
text, all old root headings, local reference targets/anchors, whitespace and
four unchanged last-root source hashes PASS. Archive179 lines; root770 before
this note. Local `layout-328-before-*` snapshots and migration utility retained
in the ignored session workspace; committed archive/anchors are portable.
No code-suite rerun: unchanged gate5262 PASS/known QDQ1 xfail stays spent.
No protected studies/native/Arm/model/dependency/download/hardware work.
Next typed bounded native goal history, then default-off recorder retention
and closed matched delivery; all eight qualification/admission flags false.

## 329. Typed Bounded Native Goal Computation History (2026-11-12)

Begin clean pushed9a3fb69. Add separate four-key typed goal history validation,
not retention/publication. Independently validate the current closed intake
and <=8 saved packets before epoch/profile/world-input/ordering joins. Preserve
native/true-pose/yaw word correspondence, exact inferred uint64/int64 world
values, canonical finite float64 words, finite builtin uint32 storage words
and literal false flags. Existing Config validation is reused with every field
required; unsupported metadata, nonfinite words and zero-word mismatches reject
explicitly without changing inputs. No cast/trig/noise/error law or source/
physical/clock/one-use/admission qualification follows from these joins.

Fresh27/60s, necessary repair27/60s reserve, root/360s. First27 PASS3.88s, no
failure/repair; root PASS5289, known QDQ1 xfail/77 warnings164.71s. Root/scoped
Ruff, changed format/whitespace, four hashes and every old source/control/
decorator AST PASS. <=9 packet validations (current plus8), <=18 canonical
decodes/23 data words/scalars and <=25 fixed Config fields per packet.
Eight entries/gaps and signed/unsigned extremes are supported; ninth entry,
wrong types, flags, epoch/profile/order, noncanonical/nonfinite data, native/
yaw ties, storage and malformed current prototype reject. Shifted/repeated
metadata are bounded unit fixtures only: not native acquisition history,
coverage, timing, execution or labels. Both executed positions spent; unused
repair is not refunded authority. Ignored `.git/returns-329-*` logs/hashes
retained, no protected/native/Arm/model/dependency/download/hardware work.
Next default-off <=8-record native goal recorder retention with prevalidation,
original/closing ownership, exact-repeat deduplication, changed-repeat
rejection, native-tick trimming and retained gaps; publication is later.
