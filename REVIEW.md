# Research Review: Jev-like Classifier on STM32N6

Status: Independent review of [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) and the repository state.
Review date: 2026-10-13. Update 2 (2026-10-14, §12) covers the robot
decision-module clarification and an external AI analysis; it corrects F1, F2,
and §7.2 in place. Update 3 (2026-10-19, §70) is a whole-repository code,
design and process review. Section 71 records the subsequent independent code
repairs; product decisions remain deferred.
Scope: feasibility, verification of design claims, landscape changes, design
gaps, alternatives, risks, and concrete next steps.

Method:

- Read DESIGN.md, README.md, and the `.devcontainer` setup.
- Re-checked hardware and compiler claims against ST Edge AI Core 4.0.1
  documentation, ST product pages, and ST example projects.
- Re-checked teacher claims against Hugging Face model cards, usage documents,
  configurations, and the published custom model source.
- Established what "Jev" is from TypeSafe's documentation, API reference, and
  customer agreement.
- Surveyed recent open "Jev-style" models, tiny-NLP research, and published
  STM32N6 measurements.
- Ran local arithmetic and an ONNX export/INT8 QDQ check inside the devcontainer.
- After the review, with your approval, implemented and measured an INT8 Vela
  2.0 9B teacher loader on the devcontainer's 12 GB GPU (F2).

Not done, and why:

- No NPU compilation: ST Edge AI Core is not installed (`/opt/st-tools` is empty).
- No board measurement: no hardware attached.
- Teachers other than the INT8 Vela 2.0 9B were not executed: Vela and Decision
  models require `trust_remote_code`, i.e. running third-party Python, which
  needs code review and your approval per release.
- The PDF (Idea0.pdf) is not in the workspace, so PDF-derived statements in the
  design could not be rechecked against their source.

Estimates in this document are labelled as estimates. Everything else is cited.

## Recovery and Document Layout (2026-11-09)

Following the user's reported crash, the live review was a 262,527-byte exact
prefix of checkpoint `c226192`; the test file preserved a 7,223-byte local
selection-retention insertion followed by a truncated checkpoint prefix. The
source edit was complete. Preserved all five live context/source files under
`.git/recovery-20261109-PmbQpU/`, then mechanically appended only verified missing
checkpoint tails. The local source and test edits remain uncommitted; syntax
compilation passed. No interrupted experiment result or full gate is inferred.

Current read-only observations: 16 GiB available memory, no swap in use; the
current container reports zero OOM/OOM-kill events and a peak of 5,403,422,720
bytes. These counters do not cover a previous container or establish the crash
cause. Workspace storage is 21 MiB, the user cache 65 MiB, Git 132 MiB; disk has
328 GiB free. No cache, setting, security control or user file was deleted.

Lossless reorganization: the former 13,046-line design is a 111-line reading map
plus 16 topic chapters; the former 18,389-line review is a short recent-checkpoint
view plus nine numbered archives. Every original section and bibliography
definition is retained. Relative links are rebased, historical heading aliases
preserved, and pre-existing conflicting reference definitions retain Markdown's
first-definition behavior. This reduces routine context reads; it is not proof
that document size caused OOM or that crashes are fixed.

Validation: the first local-only migration dry run rejected a pre-existing
conflicting reference label without changing project documents. After preserving
all definitions, the dry run and written-layout check passed: 30 Markdown files,
no new broken local target/anchor; one existing unresolved target is unchanged.
Section allocation conservation and whitespace checks passed. No code suite was
rerun for this documentation change. Recovery snapshots, complete pre-migration
documents and the migration/check utility remain in the local recovery directory.

After the split, editor reads still showed pre-migration review text while
terminal reads showed the written layout. Validation therefore uses the on-disk
files; a stale editor buffer must not overwrite the recovered layout. This
discrepancy is recorded without claiming it explains the original interruption.

Next: verify the interrupted selection-retention increment with its original
finite fixture limits, counting the interruption rather than assuming success.
All qualification/admission flags remain false. Future checkpoints belong here
briefly, with whole older sections moved through the reading map rather than
repeated historical handoffs.

## 331. Exact Retained Native Goal Matching (2026-11-12)

Begin clean pushed31a8dd1. Add a separate bounded retained matcher, not
publication. Independently validate a four-key target with32-character epoch,
typed C1-range tick/delivery and two finite builtin uint32 goal words before
retained history. Require <=8 independently validated typed records and one
unique exact epoch/tick/delivery match, then exact stored-word correspondence.
Return a detached record; missing/ambiguous/unsupported/nonfinite/changed-word
targets reject explicitly without partial output. Equal numerical zeros with
different storage words remain unresolved, not normalized. All flags false;
no source/geometry/error/clock/one-use/physical/admission qualification follows.

Fresh15/60s, necessary repair15/60s reserve, root/360s. First15 PASS4.02s, no
failure/repair; root PASS5329, known QDQ1 xfail/77 warnings188.07s. Root/scoped
Ruff, changed format/whitespace, four hashes and every old source/control/
decorator AST PASS. <=8 retained candidates/9 packet validations, one detached
result; one actual setup capture/intake, no replay/draw/trig/clock/geometry in
matching. Typed targets, empty/oversized/nonlist histories, exact epoch/tick/
delivery, ambiguity, raw unknown words, zero storage ties and detached false
flags are covered. Both executed positions spent; unused repair is not
refunded authority. Ignored `.git/returns-331-*` logs/hashes retained, no
protected/native/Arm/model/dependency/download/hardware work. Next separately
closed default-off goal publication from delivered/pending bindings, preserving
original/closing owner/native/RNG/profile/pose/input/history/stored-word joins
and explicit unknown without partial fields.

## 332. Closed Default-Off Native Goal Delivery (2026-11-12)

Begin pushed5b0b7cb with retained matching complete; resumed untested local
publication work preserved. Reverify main/upstream0/0, Python3.12.3 at
/opt/venv, Ruff0.17.0, timeout and365GiB free. Add independent literal
default-off delivered-goal publication. Disabled work returns explicit unknown
without reads/payload; enabled work prevalidates <=8 retained raw records,
joins actual encoded State frame and exact stored goal words, and closes
original/closing owner/cache/native/RNG/profile/pose/input/history/dynamics/
source-file/output correspondence. Unsupported or missing correspondence is
explicit unknown without epoch/tick/frame/goal fields. All eight flags false.

Frozen C1 has zero odometry latency: this supports delivered-only latency0,
not a new pending profile. Positive latency is explicit unsupported domain;
no accepted profile/interface/noise/numerical/physical/clock/execution/one-use/
source/admission requirement changed. State has three goal components; the
unchanged encoder binds all three, and its planar first two float32 words
match retained storage. No replay/step/read-environment/RNG/trig/clock/geometry
work in publication.

Fresh20/60s, necessary20/60s repair reserve, root/360s. First19 PASS/1 FAIL
4.74s: publication incorrectly expected a two-component State goal. Source
repair validates actual three-component planar shape and extracts its first
two words; valid mismatch fixture and work instrumentation added. Repair19
PASS/1 FAIL5.41s: new file-check wrapper passed self to the existing static
helper, causing early unknowns. Necessary fixture-only revised20/60s:
20 PASS4.14s; assert closing branches reached, two views/matches/file checks
and unchanged <=12 digest cap. Three fresh required controls/60s verify missing
current/dynamics and a closing producer mutation of same-list history:
3 PASS3.55s after moving the last producer observation before owner closure.
No unchanged green20 rerun. Root PASS5352, known QDQ1 xfail/77 warnings
171.08s. Root/scoped Ruff, changed format/whitespace, four hashes, every prior
source/control/decorator AST and scoped local references PASS;
Pylance confirms State.goal_m tuple[float,float,float]. All executed positions
remain spent; ignored `.git/returns-332-*` logs/hashes retained. No protected/
native/Arm/model/dependency/download/hardware work. Pending domain remains a
separate prerequisite, not permission to alter C1. Next bounded supplied-word
native goal delta discrepancies, preserving unsupported/nonfinite unknowns
and unresolved equal-value/different-word ties; no geometry/error adoption.

## 333. Supplied-Word Native Goal Delta Discrepancies (2026-11-12)

Begin clean pushed3a198b4. Add bounded supplied world-minus-used-position
residuals for two native goal axes. Preserve the supplied inferred float64/
int64/uint64 dtype and exact words; finite canonical operands prevalidate
before exact arithmetic. Validated <=64-bit integers use exact Fraction,
not the existing generic arithmetic value helper's float conversion. A bounded
six-line local diagnostic confirmed int64 max loses its original word through
that generic conversion; no helper/producer/interface semantics changed.
The comparison is the unrounded preserved input difference versus observed
delta, including any conversion discrepancy, not a NumPy coercion/rounding law.
Observed infinity returns explicit unknown residual while retaining raw words
and finite exact difference; unsupported/NaN inputs reject without mutation.
Zero signs remain raw words, not normalized or numerically qualified.

Fresh24/60s, necessary repair24/60s reserve, root/360s. First23 PASS/1 FAIL4.88s:
the eight-bit exhausted-budget fixture used small exact integers which fit.
Fixture-only repair supplies canonical0.1; only that necessary case ran:
1 PASS3.82s, unchanged green23 not repeated. Root PASS5376, known QDQ1 xfail/
77 warnings172.68s; root Ruff PASS, format check FAIL only for Ruff-required
parentheses around0.1.hex(). Formatter-only repair preserves the tested AST
exactly; changed format/whitespace PASS, no green semantic/root Ruff rerun.
Four before hashes PASS; final hashes retained. Every prior source/control/
decorator AST and scoped references PASS. <=2 entries/6 word decodes/
4 binary operations/6 value conversions, <=4096 arithmetic bits. Integer
extremes, subnormal/nonzero residuals, overflow, signed zero, malformed dtype/
words/shape/types and literal permission/work budgets are covered. Executed
positions remain spent; ignored `.git/returns-333-*` logs/hashes retained.
No replay/RNG/trig/clock/geometry/source/numerical/error/physical/one-use/
admission adoption, all eight flags false; no protected/native/Arm/model/
dependency/download/hardware work. Next matched retained native goal delta
reports with original/closing typed source/operand/output joins. Archive
whole321-325 before further root review growth.

## 334. Intact Native Goal Prerequisite Checkpoint Archival (2026-11-12)

Begin clean pushedc64cbce. Before further review growth, move whole321-325
to [their archive][chapter-review-29], preserving byte-exact bodies/headings/separators, failures,
approvals, spent ledgers and historical next-action wording. Five root heading
anchors remain archive links; four live chapter03 checkpoint references
rebase, and section322's existing311-315 archive label is copied relative to
the new archive. Historical requirements/limits/authority are unchanged.

One fresh mechanical migration/30s PASS, no failure or repair; exact retained
block/prior headings, eleven scoped local links/anchors, whitespace and all
four tested source hashes PASS. Root816 lines before this note; archive163.
No code changes or green code/native/Arm/sanitizer rerun, new studies/models/
dependencies/downloads/hardware work or qualification adoption. Local before
snapshots and bounded migration utility retained in session files; portable
evidence remains committed documents. Next original/closing matched retained
native goal delta reports without replay, extra draws, law/bound adoption or
qualification shortcuts.

## 335. Matched Native Goal Delta Reports WIP and Pause (2026-11-12)

Begin clean pusheda165ac5. Add literal default-off
`include_goal_delta_residuals`, requiring goal computation inclusion. Delivered
reports reuse independently validated retained world/used-position/delta
words, retain exact source epoch/tick/delivery labels, and close original/
closing source/operand/report/output joins before publication. No new pending
domain, replay/draw/trig/clock/geometry/law/bound or qualification adoption;
all eight flags false. This implementation is WIP, not a completed root gate.

Fresh26/60s, necessary repair26/60s reserve, root/360s. One no-write patch
context miss was repaired before execution. Focused26 PASS4.29s/4453 deselected:
reuse23 delta-mode publication cases plus3 literal/dependency/outgoing-report
controls; unchanged plain-mode controls await required root regression.
<=2 reports/4 entries/12 word decodes/12 value conversions/8 binary operations,
unchanged <=2 intakes/views/matches/file checks and <=12 binding digests.
Pylance before/after found no resolved dynamic callers, not static compatibility
proof.

The user explicitly paused during the root run; stop the owned process
immediately. Partial log ends during pytest progress at85%, without a full
result or subsequent style gate. The root position is spent/aborted, not passed
or refunded. Last completed root remains5376, known QDQ1 xfail/77 warnings
from§333. Retain `.git/returns-335-*` logs/hashes and local WIP; the subsequent
explicit user request authorizes a WIP commit and pause, not another code run
or implementation slice. Scoped WIP whitespace/four tested hashes and every
unrelated source/control/decorator AST pass; no code gate is rerun. Next only
after a fresh actual continuation request:
revalidate the retained worktree/environment and finish the necessary bounded
root/style/conservation gate without repeating unchanged green focused controls.
No new source qualification, protected study/model/dependency/download/hardware
work, or numerical/physical/clock/execution/one-use/admission evidence.

## 336. Current-State Review and Native Goal Boundary Repairs (2026-11-13)

Review/fix request replaces the pause with a bounded current-state review,
not automatic continuation of the feature queue. Begin clean main7c25f6e;
fetch confirms upstream0/0, no live pytest job, Python3.12.3 at /opt/venv,
pytest8.4.2, Ruff0.17.0, timeout and365GiB free. Review the active public/design/
milestone status and goal capture/intake/retention/delivery/report ownership
chain with its nearby controls. Qualified baseline/source/coverage/error/
timing/one-use/admission and ST/board readiness remain unresolved; no learned/
hardware/physical capability follows from fixture success.

Recover the existing §335 log's actual footer:5402 PASS, known QDQ1 xfail/
77 warnings177.00s, source hashes identical to WIP. This is recovered pytest
output, not proof of the interrupted command chain's exit or style checks.
Keep the historical root position spent/aborted and the pause record intact.
The fresh complete gate below is tied to substantive review fixes.

Ten fresh repro controls/60s all FAIL9.77s: the last producer observation,
and optional closing report, ran after the last native source intake, allowing
in-place raw-cache/nonfinite or true-pose changes to publish stale diagnostics.
Retention had the same last-observation gap. Malformed current tuples/dynamics
lists leaked IndexError/AttributeError instead of explicit ValueError/unknown.
Move the final producer/report work before the final closed source intake;
close ownership afterwards. Prevalidate actual current tuple/State/frame and
dynamics dictionary before indexing or consuming them. Do not broaden catches,
change arithmetic, accept nonfinite data, or add source reads/draws.

Necessary affected controls84/60s PASS5.59s, including all10 formerly failing
cases and plain/delta/default-off/gap/dedup/trim controls. Existing <=2 intakes/
views/matches/file checks, <=12 binding digests and <=2 reports/4 entries/
12 decodes/12 rational values/8 binary operations remain unchanged.
Fresh root/360s PASS5412, known QDQ1 xfail/77 warnings182.47s; root Ruff,
changed-file format, whitespace and all four before/after source hashes PASS.
Pylance reports no errors in the owning diagnostics file; unrelated source/
control/decorator AST and scoped local links/anchors conserved. All executed
positions spent; ignored `.git/review-336-*` logs/hashes retained.

Matched retained goal delta publication now has a completed required gate,
not numerical/geometry/noise/source/execution/physical/admission qualification;
all eight flags false. No native/C/Arm/ST/model/study/dependency/download/
hardware changes or extra opt-in runs. Current review/fixes complete; leave the
ordered feature queue untouched pending the user's next instruction.

## 337. Supplied-Word Native Goal Expression Residuals (2026-11-13)

Fresh actual continuation resumes from clean pushedff4ec39, main/upstream0/0,
Python3.12.3 at /opt/venv, Ruff0.17.0/pytest8.4.2/timeout verified. Owning goal
code already captures consumed delta/cosine/sine and final native components.
Add a separate supplied-word comparison for `c*dx+s*dy` and `-s*dx+c*dy`.
Use the observed delta, not recomputed world-minus-position or asserted true
yaw coefficients. Do not normalize coefficients, add intermediate arithmetic
to the producer, replay or adopt trig/noise/rounding/geometry/error laws.
Canonical finite input words prevalidate; observed infinity preserves raw
words with unknown residual, unsupported/NaN inputs reject without mutation.
Signed-zero words remain supplied distinctions, all eight flags false.

Fresh24/60s, necessary repair24/60s reserve, root/360s. First24 PASS3.84s/
4489 deselected, no repair. <=2 entries/6 decodes/6 rational values/8 binary

only for the actual-word control; no replay/draw/trig/clock/geometry in helper.
Independent Fraction controls cover transpose sign, non-unit consumed
coefficients, cancellation, signed residuals/zeros, subnormal, overflow and
literal/type/shape/canonical/work-budget failures. Root PASS5436, known QDQ1
xfail/77 warnings327.92s in the shared environment, within360s; root Ruff,
changed format/whitespace/four hashes and prior source/control/decorator AST/
scoped local references PASS. Both executed positions spent, unused repair
not refunded authority; ignored `.git/returns-337-*` logs/hashes retained.
No source/physical/clock/execution/one-use/admission qualification, studies/
models/dependencies/downloads/hardware/native/Arm or extra opt-in work.
Next archive whole326-330 before further review growth, then separately
matched retained native goal expression reports with closed source/output
joins and unchanged default-off/unknown behaviour.

## 338. Intact Goal Ownership Checkpoint Archival (2026-11-13)

Begin clean pushede194890. Move whole326-330 to
[their archive][chapter-review-30] before further review growth. Preserve exact
bodies/headings/separators, failures, approvals, spent ledgers and historical
next actions; all five root heading anchors remain archive links. Rebase four
chapter03 goal references and copy section328's existing316-320 archive label
relative to its new location. No historical limits/authority are renewed.

One fresh mechanical migration/30s PASS, no failure/repair; exact block/prior
headings, eleven scoped local links/anchors, whitespace and all four last-tested
source hashes PASS. Root820 lines before this note; archive151. Local before
snapshots and bounded utility retained in session files, portable evidence in
Git documents. No code edit/green code-suite rerun/native/Arm/model/study/

default-off matched native goal expression reports, preserving consumed
coefficients/delta and original/closing source/operand/report/output joins.

## 339. Matched Retained Native Goal Expression Reports (2026-11-13)

Begin clean pushed7c22b12. Add independent literal default-off expression
report inclusion requiring goal computation. Closed retained consumed
coefficients/observed delta/native components feed the supplied-word helper;
detached reports preserve exact source epoch/tick/delivery labels. Original/
closing source/operand/report/output joins close before publication, including
final intake after both reports and the last producer observation. Unsupported,
changed or nonfinite joins return explicit unknown without partial fields.
No coefficient normalization, trig/noise/rounding/geometry/error adoption;
all eight flags false, zero-latency delivered-only C1 domain unchanged.

Fresh54/60s, necessary repair54/60s reserve, root/360s. First54 PASS4.99s/

Root PASS5490, known QDQ1 xfail/77 warnings178.71s; root Ruff, changed format/

goal-word correspondence, not predicted casting or an error bound.

## 340. Supplied Native and Stored Goal-Word Correspondence (2026-11-13)

Begin clean pushed5d75cd3. Add a separate two-axis final-native/stored goal
word diagnostic using the existing uint32-to-float32 view and bounded exact
residual helper. Preserve canonical supplied native words and finite builtin
uint32 storage as required by closed goal history. Report decoded observed
storage minus supplied native value; numerical equality and decoded-word
equality stay separate. Equal zeros with different words remain ties, not
normalized signs or casting predictions. Supplied native +/-inf produces
explicit unknown residual/equalities; unsupported/NaN/nonfinite storage
rejects without mutation, retaining raw inputs. No rounding/error/noise/
geometry/source/clock/execution/physical/admission adoption, eight flags false.

Fresh24/60s, necessary repair24/60s reserve, root/360s. First24 PASS14.06s/

raw unknown native words and typed/canonical/storage/permission/work budgets.
Root PASS5514, known QDQ1 xfail/77 warnings199.70s; root Ruff, changed format/
