# Research Review: Jev-like Classifier on STM32N6

Status: Independent review of [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) and the repository state.
Review date: 2026-10-13. Update 2 (2026-10-14, §12) covers the robot
decision-module clarification and an external AI analysis; it corrects F1, F2,
and §7.2 in place. Update 3 (2026-10-19, §70) is a whole-repository code,
design and process review. Section 71 records the subsequent independent code
repairs; product decisions remain deferred.
Scope: feasibility, verification of design claims, landscape changes, design
gaps, alternatives, risks, and concrete next steps.

Method:

- Read DESIGN.md, README.md, and the `.devcontainer` setup.
- Re-checked hardware and compiler claims against ST Edge AI Core 4.0.1
  documentation, ST product pages, and ST example projects.
- Re-checked teacher claims against Hugging Face model cards, usage documents,
  configurations, and the published custom model source.
- Established what "Jev" is from TypeSafe's documentation, API reference, and
  customer agreement.
- Surveyed recent open "Jev-style" models, tiny-NLP research, and published
  STM32N6 measurements.
- Ran local arithmetic and an ONNX export/INT8 QDQ check inside the devcontainer.
- After the review, with your approval, implemented and measured an INT8 Vela
  2.0 9B teacher loader on the devcontainer's 12 GB GPU (F2).

Not done, and why:

- No NPU compilation: ST Edge AI Core is not installed (`/opt/st-tools` is empty).
- No board measurement: no hardware attached.
- Teachers other than the INT8 Vela 2.0 9B were not executed: Vela and Decision
  models require `trust_remote_code`, i.e. running third-party Python, which
  needs code review and your approval per release.
- The PDF (Idea0.pdf) is not in the workspace, so PDF-derived statements in the
  design could not be rechecked against their source.

Estimates in this document are labelled as estimates. Everything else is cited.

## Recovery and Document Layout (2026-11-09)

Following the user's reported crash, the live review was a 262,527-byte exact
prefix of checkpoint `c226192`; the test file preserved a 7,223-byte local
selection-retention insertion followed by a truncated checkpoint prefix. The
source edit was complete. Preserved all five live context/source files under
`.git/recovery-20261109-PmbQpU/`, then mechanically appended only verified missing
checkpoint tails. The local source and test edits remain uncommitted; syntax
compilation passed. No interrupted experiment result or full gate is inferred.

Current read-only observations: 16 GiB available memory, no swap in use; the
current container reports zero OOM/OOM-kill events and a peak of 5,403,422,720
bytes. These counters do not cover a previous container or establish the crash
cause. Workspace storage is 21 MiB, the user cache 65 MiB, Git 132 MiB; disk has
328 GiB free. No cache, setting, security control or user file was deleted.

Lossless reorganization: the former 13,046-line design is a 111-line reading map
plus 16 topic chapters; the former 18,389-line review is a short recent-checkpoint
view plus nine numbered archives. Every original section and bibliography
definition is retained. Relative links are rebased, historical heading aliases
preserved, and pre-existing conflicting reference definitions retain Markdown's
first-definition behavior. This reduces routine context reads; it is not proof
that document size caused OOM or that crashes are fixed.

Validation: the first local-only migration dry run rejected a pre-existing
conflicting reference label without changing project documents. After preserving
all definitions, the dry run and written-layout check passed: 30 Markdown files,
no new broken local target/anchor; one existing unresolved target is unchanged.
Section allocation conservation and whitespace checks passed. No code suite was
rerun for this documentation change. Recovery snapshots, complete pre-migration
documents and the migration/check utility remain in the local recovery directory.

After the split, editor reads still showed pre-migration review text while
terminal reads showed the written layout. Validation therefore uses the on-disk
files; a stale editor buffer must not overwrite the recovered layout. This
discrepancy is recorded without claiming it explains the original interruption.

Next: verify the interrupted selection-retention increment with its original
finite fixture limits, counting the interruption rather than assuming success.
All qualification/admission flags remain false. Future checkpoints belong here
briefly, with whole older sections moved through the reading map rather than
repeated historical handoffs.

## 341. Matched Retained Goal Storage Reports (2026-11-13)

Begin clean pushed6985259. Add independent literal default-off storage report
inclusion requiring goal computation. Closed typed retained final-native/
stored words feed the supplied helper, with exact epoch/tick/delivery labels.
Original/closing source/operand/report/output joins close before publication;
the final intake follows all enabled reports and the last observation.
Unsupported, changed or nonfinite source returns explicit unknown without
partial fields. Numeric/word equality and zero ties remain separate; no
rounding/error/noise/geometry/source/execution/physical/admission adoption,
all eight flags false, zero-latency C1 delivery domain unchanged.

Fresh104/60s, necessary repair104/60s reserve, root/360s. First104 PASS6.14s/
4591 deselected, no repair:100 new storage-only/combined publication cases
plus4 literal/dependency/outgoing-report/changed-stored-word controls.
Existing-mode focused cases not rerun. Storage <=2 reports/4 entries/native
decodes/storage views/8 rational values/4 subtractions; earlier delta/expression
family caps unchanged. All-mode <=32 rational values/28 binary operations;
original <=2 intakes/views/matches/file checks and <=12 digests unchanged.
Root PASS5618, known QDQ1 xfail/77 warnings233.93s; root Ruff, changed format/
whitespace/four hashes, prior unrelated source/control/decorator AST and scoped
references PASS. Both executed positions spent, unused repair not authority;
ignored `.git/returns-341-*` logs/hashes retained. No replay/draw/trig/clock/
geometry, protected study/model/dependency/download/hardware/native/Arm or
extra opt-in work. Next reassess supported named-consumer setup/source/
coverage/error/timing prerequisites and request/guard/executor dependencies;
do not duplicate completed integration, floor or native goal reports.

## 342. Supplied Pre-Integration Speed-Update Residuals (2026-11-13)

Begin clean pushedd90142c; actual main/upstream0/0, Python3.12.3 at
/opt/venv and installed Ruff verified. Named-consumer Q2 explicitly includes
the acceleration update before integration. Existing motion receipts retain
initial speed, observed clipped target, Config acceleration/dt and updated
speed; completed integration reports do not cover this expression.

Add a separate five-word exact comparison: prior speed plus the unrounded
clamp of target-minus-prior to +/-acceleration*dt, then observed updated speed
minus that result. Preserve supplied canonical words, signed zeros and raw
nonfinite updated speed as explicit unknown. Finite operands and positive
acceleration/dt follow the existing Config domain. This does not recheck
submitted-action clipping, predict intermediate rounding/native branches or
establish uniform/propagated error. No producer/controller/capture change,
replay/draw/trig/clock/geometry or qualification/admission; eight flags false.

Fresh24/60s, necessary repair24/60s reserve, root/360s. First24 PASS4.52s/
4695 deselected, no semantic repair. <=5 words/decodes/rational values,
4 arithmetic operations and2 growth-checked comparisons, existing4096-bit

step/capture; direct Fraction cases cover both clamp sides/boundaries, target
reach, nonzero residual, zero signs, subnormal/unknown output and rejection/
permission/work limits. Root pytest PASS5642, known QDQ1 xfail/77 warnings
226.60s. Root Ruff initially failed RUF059 for two unused local bindings;
rename only those bindings, verify neither is read, then root Ruff/changed
format/whitespace PASS without rerunning green semantic gates. Four hashes
matched before the lint repair; final hashes retained. All prior module/control/
decorator ASTs conserved, owning-file Pylance0 errors, scoped links PASS.
Executed positions remain spent; unused repair is not renewed authority.
Ignored `.git/returns-342-*` logs/hashes retained. No protected study/model/
dependency/download/hardware/native/Arm or additional opt-in work.
Next supplied target/yaw clipping correspondence from existing receipt fields,
then supported closed current receipt/update reports; Q0-Q5 acceptance remains
unresolved, with no usable command admitted.

## 343. Supplied Target and Yaw Clipping Correspondence (2026-11-13)

Begin clean pushedc5257e4. Owning RoverEnv.step clips submitted speed to the
existing [0,max_speed] and yaw rate to [-max_turn_rate,max_turn_rate]; actual
receipts already retain submitted/profile/clipped words. Existing receipt
chain checks validate duration/continuity/final action, not these clamps.
Separate six-word diagnostics follow the completed ToF clamp-word pattern,
without generalizing its64-ray schema or changing either producer.

Report exact selected-value ratios and numeric/unique-candidate word
correspondence separately. Equal-valued different zero candidates remain
unresolved, not normalized or selected by an inferred native branch law.
Canonical +/-inf action/output is unknown per component; NaN/invalid words
or nonfinite/nonpositive existing Config limits reject, raw inputs unchanged.
No rounding/error/source/timing/physical/command adoption; eight flags false.

Fresh24/60s, necessary repair24/60s reserve, root/360s. First24 PASS5.44s/
4719 deselected, no repair. Fixed <=6 decodes,2 entries,4 min/max comparisons,
6 candidate/2 observed numeric equalities and2 builtin dyadic ratios; <=3
candidate words per entry. No rational engine or arithmetic. The actual control
consumes the existing captured receipt without additional capture; independent
Fraction controls cover both sides/boundaries, identity, zero selection ties/
word mismatches, subnormal, nonfinite and shape/profile/permission/work limits.
Root PASS5666, known QDQ1 xfail/77 warnings193.37s; root Ruff/changed format/
whitespace/four hashes and prior module/control/decorator AST conservation/
scoped references PASS. Executed positions spent; unused repair not authority.
Ignored `.git/returns-343-*` logs/hashes retained. No replay/draw/trig/clock/
geometry, protected study/model/dependency/download/hardware/native/Arm or
extra opt-in work. Next lossless whole331-335 archival before more root growth,
then supported closed current receipt/update reports. Q0-Q5 still requires
independent acceptance; no usable command is admitted.

## 344. Intact Goal Delivery Checkpoint Archival (2026-11-13)

Begin clean pusheda30b62d. Before further review growth, move complete331-335
to [their archive][chapter-review-31], preserving byte-exact bodies/headings/
separators, failures, approvals, spent ledgers and historical next actions.
In particular§335's WIP/pause/aborted-root wording remains intact; later§336
recovery is separate evidence, not a rewritten historical pass.
Five old root anchors remain archive links; four chapter03 checkpoint
references rebase; section334's existing321-325 archive label is copied
relative to the new archive. Nothing renews test authority or qualification.

One fresh mechanical migration/30s PASS, no failure/repair. Exact whole block/
prior headings, eleven scoped link/anchor targets, whitespace and all four
green-tested source hashes PASS. Root864 lines before this note, archive155.
No code suite/native/Arm/sanitizer rerun or new study/model/dependency/
download/hardware work. Local before snapshots and bounded bulk migration
utility retained in session files; committed documents remain portable.
Next supported closed current receipt/update reports using the completed
supplied clipping/speed-update diagnostics, without source/controller replay,
extra draws, native-error-law adoption or usable command admission.

## 345. Closed Current Receipt Motion-Update Reports (2026-11-13)

Begin clean pushedf0723c0. Add literal default-off
include_native_motion_update to the existing owned current receipt-history
reader. No caller source/tick/epoch override or new capture. Current bound
receipt words feed both completed supplied clipping/speed-update helpers;
copied reports retain source epoch/transition ticks/receipt binding and
current frame. Original/closing report and source/owner/history joins precede
publication. Disabled output shape/report work remains unchanged; unsupported,
nonfinite or changed content is explicit unknown without partial payload.
Equal-value/different-word clipping candidates stay unresolved. Eight flags
false; no native rounding/error/source/clock/physical/execution/admission law.

Coupled source prerequisite: two new final-observation controls reproduced
stale pose/history publication,2 FAIL5.87s/4743 deselected. The reader sampled
pose before observation and closed owner content before its last observation.
Move each observation before sampled words and the final producer sample
before final owner binding, preserving the original two-observation cap.
Add typed current layout guards before consumption; no broad error catches.

Fresh34/60s (24 new modes/mutations,2 reproductions,8 directly affected

Root PASS5692, known QDQ1 xfail/77 warnings190.62s; root Ruff/changed format/

not all dynamic test references. All executed positions remain spent.
Ignored `.git/returns-345-*` logs/hashes retained; no protected study/model/
dependency/download/hardware/native/Arm or extra opt-in work. Next reassess
remaining supported Q2 segment/time and request/guard/executor prerequisites;
uniform source/error/timing/one-use acceptance remains independent.

## 346. Supplied Captured-Interval Division Residuals (2026-11-13)

Begin clean pushed09eea2c. RoverEnv.step computes seconds=dt/planned_segments;
existing receipt words and integration input joins retain that native interval.
The receipt chain checks its native float quotient words, not an unrounded
division residual. Add a separate bounded supplied duration/count/interval
comparison using the existing rational arithmetic helper, not a floor report
or repeated integration stage. Observed builtin planned_segments1..128 is the
consumed divisor, not a recomputed or qualified segment-selection prediction.
Canonical duration is finite/positive per existing Config; raw nonfinite
observed interval is explicit unknown with supplied words preserved. No
rounding/error/timing/source/physical/execution/admission law; eight flags false.

Fresh24/60s, necessary repair24/60s reserve, root/360s. First24 PASS4.03s/
4769 deselected, no repair; <=2 canonical decodes/3 rational values/one division/
one subtraction and existing4096-bit cap. One actual control consumes the
existing captured receipt without another step/capture; independent Fraction
cases cover divisible/nondivisible intervals, signed residual/zero/subnormal/
extreme values, raw unknown output and canonical/domain/permission/work limits.
Root PASS5716, known QDQ1 xfail/77 warnings173.83s; root Ruff/changed format/
whitespace/four hashes, every prior module/function/control/decorator AST and
scoped references PASS. Both executed positions spent; unused repair is not
authority. Ignored `.git/returns-346-*` logs/hashes retained; no replay/draw/
trig/clock/geometry, protected study/model/dependency/download/hardware/native/
Arm or additional opt-in work. Next separately default-off closed current
receipt interval reports; native segment-selection intermediates, uniform
motion error and qualified duration/clocks remain independent obligations.

## 347. Intact Motion-Word Contract Relocation (2026-11-13)

Begin clean pushedce71cf6. Chapter01 grew to2578 lines after bounded current
motion-update work; move its four complete supplied speed/clipping/interval
and current receipt-composition contracts into existing chapter04. Preserve
byte-exact bodies/headings, flags, work limits and checkpoint wording.
Four old chapter01 anchors remain reading links; four checkpoint labels copy
with unchanged relative targets, and DESIGN's short map gains a direct topic
link. A separate-topic wrapper explicitly adopts no NF1 certificate premises
or historical study/run authority; no accepted requirement changes.

One fresh mechanical migration/30s PASS, no failure/repair: exact whole block/
prior headings, nine new scoped references/anchors, whitespace and four
green-tested source hashes PASS. Chapter01 now2520/chapter04 2470, around
the existing organization target; no green code/native/Arm/sanitizer rerun.
Local before snapshots and bounded bulk migration utility retained in session
files; committed documents remain portable. Next archive whole336-340 before
further root review growth, then closed current receipt interval reports.

## 348. Intact Reviewed Goal-Expression Checkpoint Archival (2026-11-13)

Begin clean pushed0d81f0b. Move complete336-340 to
[their archive][chapter-review-32] before more review growth. Preserve exact
bodies/headings/separators, failures, approvals, spent attempts and historical
next actions. In particular§336's recovered pytest footer remains distinct
from§335's spent/aborted command chain; archive relocation rewrites neither
evidence nor the user's later fresh continuation. Five old root anchors remain;
four chapter03 references rebase, and section338's326-330 archive label copies
relative to the new archive. No old limits or authority are renewed.

One fresh mechanical migration/30s PASS, no failure/repair; whole block/prior
headings, eleven scoped link/anchor targets, whitespace and all four tested
source hashes PASS. Root851 lines before this note/archive149. Local before
snapshots and bounded bulk migration utility retained in session files.
No green code/native/Arm/sanitizer rerun, studies/models/dependencies/
downloads/hardware or qualification adoption. Portable evidence remains Git
documents. Next closed current receipt interval reports with original/closing
source/report/output joins and all qualification flags false.
