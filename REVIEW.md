# Research Review: Jev-like Classifier on STM32N6

Status: Independent review of [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) and the repository state.
Review date: 2026-10-13. Update 2 (2026-10-14, §12) covers the robot
decision-module clarification and an external AI analysis; it corrects F1, F2,
and §7.2 in place. Update 3 (2026-10-19, §70) is a whole-repository code,
design and process review. Section 71 records the subsequent independent code
repairs; product decisions remain deferred.
Scope: feasibility, verification of design claims, landscape changes, design
gaps, alternatives, risks, and concrete next steps.

Method:

- Read DESIGN.md, README.md, and the `.devcontainer` setup.
- Re-checked hardware and compiler claims against ST Edge AI Core 4.0.1
  documentation, ST product pages, and ST example projects.
- Re-checked teacher claims against Hugging Face model cards, usage documents,
  configurations, and the published custom model source.
- Established what "Jev" is from TypeSafe's documentation, API reference, and
  customer agreement.
- Surveyed recent open "Jev-style" models, tiny-NLP research, and published
  STM32N6 measurements.
- Ran local arithmetic and an ONNX export/INT8 QDQ check inside the devcontainer.
- After the review, with your approval, implemented and measured an INT8 Vela
  2.0 9B teacher loader on the devcontainer's 12 GB GPU (F2).

Not done, and why:

- No NPU compilation: ST Edge AI Core is not installed (`/opt/st-tools` is empty).
- No board measurement: no hardware attached.
- Teachers other than the INT8 Vela 2.0 9B were not executed: Vela and Decision
  models require `trust_remote_code`, i.e. running third-party Python, which
  needs code review and your approval per release.
- The PDF (Idea0.pdf) is not in the workspace, so PDF-derived statements in the
  design could not be rechecked against their source.

Estimates in this document are labelled as estimates. Everything else is cited.

## Recovery and Document Layout (2026-11-09)

Following the user's reported crash, the live review was a 262,527-byte exact
prefix of checkpoint `c226192`; the test file preserved a 7,223-byte local
selection-retention insertion followed by a truncated checkpoint prefix. The
source edit was complete. Preserved all five live context/source files under
`.git/recovery-20261109-PmbQpU/`, then mechanically appended only verified missing
checkpoint tails. The local source and test edits remain uncommitted; syntax
compilation passed. No interrupted experiment result or full gate is inferred.

Current read-only observations: 16 GiB available memory, no swap in use; the
current container reports zero OOM/OOM-kill events and a peak of 5,403,422,720
bytes. These counters do not cover a previous container or establish the crash
cause. Workspace storage is 21 MiB, the user cache 65 MiB, Git 132 MiB; disk has
328 GiB free. No cache, setting, security control or user file was deleted.

Lossless reorganization: the former 13,046-line design is a 111-line reading map
plus 16 topic chapters; the former 18,389-line review is a short recent-checkpoint
view plus nine numbered archives. Every original section and bibliography
definition is retained. Relative links are rebased, historical heading aliases
preserved, and pre-existing conflicting reference definitions retain Markdown's
first-definition behavior. This reduces routine context reads; it is not proof
that document size caused OOM or that crashes are fixed.

Validation: the first local-only migration dry run rejected a pre-existing
conflicting reference label without changing project documents. After preserving
all definitions, the dry run and written-layout check passed: 30 Markdown files,
no new broken local target/anchor; one existing unresolved target is unchanged.
Section allocation conservation and whitespace checks passed. No code suite was
rerun for this documentation change. Recovery snapshots, complete pre-migration
documents and the migration/check utility remain in the local recovery directory.

After the split, editor reads still showed pre-migration review text while
terminal reads showed the written layout. Validation therefore uses the on-disk
files; a stale editor buffer must not overwrite the recovered layout. This
discrepancy is recorded without claiming it explains the original interruption.

Next: verify the interrupted selection-retention increment with its original
finite fixture limits, counting the interruption rather than assuming success.
All qualification/admission flags remain false. Future checkpoints belong here
briefly, with whole older sections moved through the reading map rather than
repeated historical handoffs.

[Complete unchanged checkpoint][review-321-325-preserved-4] is preserved in the archive.

## 326. Native Goal Computation Acquisition Pairing (2026-11-12)

Begin pushed991dc62, main/upstream0/0 after fetch; Python3.12.3 at `/opt/venv`,
pytest8.4.2/Ruff0.17.0/timeout installed,365GiB free in the shared environment.
Append literal default-off `capture_native_goal_computation=False` to `step`.
Reuse the cold producer's input/profile/dtype preflight before state/RNG/clock
work, then capture one actual history production into a distinct private cache.
Retain actual RNG/odometry-RNG and legacy native-source identity, cold computation
packet, acquisition tick and nominal odometry delivery tick. Goal acquisition
is independent of fresh/held ToF; reset/default steps clear this cache. Existing
goal calculations/cache keys and public observation/info/return shape remain
unchanged. Computed raw nonfinite source remains explicit unknown, all eight
flags false; no trig/noise/cast law, clock/one-use or qualification follows.
Closed typed intake, retention and delivered/pending joins remain separate.

Fresh17/60s, sole necessary fixture repair17/60s, required root/360s positions.
Per case <=3 history calls, <=1 cold receiver, <=3 geometry calls, <=8 existing
clock reads only in combined capture; paired steps have unchanged RNG/output
words and no replay/additional draws. First8 PASS/9 FAIL/2 raw warnings8.22s:
the comparison fixture applied numerical `equal_nan` to the observation schema
string. Repair compares exact types, ndarray dtype/shape/raw bytes, scalar float
hex words and nonnumerical equality, without changing producer or limits.
Revised17 PASS/2 warnings3.65s; root PASS5228, known QDQ1 xfail/75 warnings179.91s.
Root/scoped Ruff, changed-file format, whitespace and four source hashes PASS.
Scoped AST conservation retains every other source function;43 resolved step
callers have only three intentional invalid-boolean negative-fixture diagnostics
(the prior two and this slice's new control). All three positions spent; no
historical/protected refund. Ignored `.git/returns-326-*` logs/hashes retained.
No study/model/dependency/download/hardware or native/Arm/sanitizer opt-in.
Next separately close actual goal acquisition intake with original/closing
native/RNG/profile/pose/input/tick/delivery/stored-word joins and detached output.

## 327. Closed Native Goal Computation Intake (2026-11-12)

Begin pushedfde4b22. Closed intake needs the original true pose/full Config
snapshot and Scenario identity: noisy used position cannot stand in for true
pose or establish a noise bound. Add only these bounded acquisition carrier
fields; default public outputs/calculations remain unchanged. The separate
offline sampler validates actual owner,32-character epoch, existing C1 tick
encoding and <=8 nominal odometry latency/queue/history budgets. Original and
closing cache/native/RNG/Scenario/profile/true-pose/input/tick/delivery/ego/history/
stored-word joins precede one detached supported packet. Unsupported, changed
or computed nonfinite source raises explicit ValueError without partial output;
the original raw unknown packet is retained. No replay/trig/draw/clock/geometry
or numerical/noise/cast/physical/source/clock/one-use/admission qualification.
All eight flags false. Recorder retention and publication remain separate.

World-goal inferred dtype is preserved: finite float64 canonical words or
exact signed/unsigned integer words, including integers not exactly expressible
as float64. Other observed float64 operands/native values retain signed words
as canonical strings or directly copied finite scalars;
stored float32 words use the existing uint32 view. Profile scalar types and
zero-word distinctions remain intact. The carrier adds25-or-fewer fixed Config
fields and three true-pose words, not Scenario copying or a new geometry claim.

Fresh49/60s (32 intake/17 affected acquisition), necessary repair49/60s reserve,
root/360s. First49 PASS/4 retained raw warnings3.86s, no repair. Required exact
history-limit verification adds only two fresh fixtures/60s:8 accepted,9
rejected before row iteration/copy;2 PASS/32 deselected3.60s, not another green49
run. Per intake <=2 views/1 packet copy, <=8 queue/history ego rows of4 words,
<=23 captured source words/scalars plus <=25 Config fields per view. Synthetic
repeated rows test a work limit only, not source history/coverage. Root PASS5262,
known QDQ1 xfail/77 warnings168.02s; root/scoped Ruff, changed format/whitespace,
four hashes and old source/test/decorator AST conservation PASS. All three
executed positions spent; unused repair reserve is not an execution or refund.
Ignored `.git/returns-327-*` logs/hashes retained. No protected/native/Arm work.
Next separately typed bounded goal history, then default-off recorder retention
and matched delivery with original/closing joins; no permission/admission.

## 328. Intact Goal-Prerequisite Review Archival (2026-11-12)

Begin clean pusheda8dc8e6. Before further review growth, move whole316-320
checkpoints to [their archive][chapter-review-28]: bodies, headings, separators,
failures, spent/unused ledgers and historical limits remain byte-exact. Preserve
all five old root anchors as archive links; rebase four chapter03 report links
and copy the existing306-310 archive reference relative to its new location.
Update only the root reading map and short current state; no requirements,
source, control, authority or qualification changes.

One finite preflight/apply/verify position PASS, no failure/repair. Exact archive
text, all old root headings, local reference targets/anchors, whitespace and
four unchanged last-root source hashes PASS. Archive179 lines; root770 before
this note. Local `layout-328-before-*` snapshots and migration utility retained
in the ignored session workspace; committed archive/anchors are portable.
No code-suite rerun: unchanged gate5262 PASS/known QDQ1 xfail stays spent.
No protected studies/native/Arm/model/dependency/download/hardware work.
Next typed bounded native goal history, then default-off recorder retention
and closed matched delivery; all eight qualification/admission flags false.

## 329. Typed Bounded Native Goal Computation History (2026-11-12)

Begin clean pushed9a3fb69. Add separate four-key typed goal history validation,
not retention/publication. Independently validate the current closed intake
and <=8 saved packets before epoch/profile/world-input/ordering joins. Preserve
native/true-pose/yaw word correspondence, exact inferred uint64/int64 world
values, canonical finite float64 words, finite builtin uint32 storage words
and literal false flags. Existing Config validation is reused with every field
required; unsupported metadata, nonfinite words and zero-word mismatches reject
explicitly without changing inputs. No cast/trig/noise/error law or source/
physical/clock/one-use/admission qualification follows from these joins.

Fresh27/60s, necessary repair27/60s reserve, root/360s. First27 PASS3.88s, no
failure/repair; root PASS5289, known QDQ1 xfail/77 warnings164.71s. Root/scoped
Ruff, changed format/whitespace, four hashes and every old source/control/
decorator AST PASS. <=9 packet validations (current plus8), <=18 canonical
decodes/23 data words/scalars and <=25 fixed Config fields per packet.
Eight entries/gaps and signed/unsigned extremes are supported; ninth entry,
wrong types, flags, epoch/profile/order, noncanonical/nonfinite data, native/
yaw ties, storage and malformed current prototype reject. Shifted/repeated
metadata are bounded unit fixtures only: not native acquisition history,
coverage, timing, execution or labels. Both executed positions spent; unused
repair is not refunded authority. Ignored `.git/returns-329-*` logs/hashes
retained, no protected/native/Arm/model/dependency/download/hardware work.
Next default-off <=8-record native goal recorder retention with prevalidation,
original/closing ownership, exact-repeat deduplication, changed-repeat
rejection, native-tick trimming and retained gaps; publication is later.

## 330. Default-Off Native Goal Recorder Retention (2026-11-12)

Begin clean pushed8962f07. Add an independent literal default-off recorder
method and empty builtin goal history. Disabled inclusion is a no-op; enabled
work requires the current bound C1 producer. Prevalidate retained raw typed
words before source intake/digests; close original/closing owner/cache/native/
RNG/profile/pose/input/current-frame/history/stored-word/source-file bindings
before changing recorder history. Keep <=8 detached records, exact-repeat
deduplication, changed-repeat rejection, native-tick trimming and skipped gaps.
Unchanged repeats preserve history identity; a repeat still trims supported
expired older records. No publication, replay, draw, trig, clock or geometry
work during retention. All flags false; no numerical/noise/physical/clock/
one-use/source/admission qualification from matching words or digests.

Fresh24/60s, necessary fixture repair24/60s, root/360s. Before execution correct
the prospective validator bound4 to5 for prevalidation, original/candidate and
both closing validations; no position spent/refunded. First22 PASS/2 FAIL5.49s:
gap/trim fixtures assumed capture tick2, but owning setup captures at4. Necessary
fixture-only repair derives the actual native start:24 PASS4.47s, no source/
work/tolerance change. One fresh closing-owner-clear control/60s verifies a
necessary explicit ValueError guard before tuple access:1 PASS/24 deselected
3.84s, not another green24 run. Root PASS5314, known QDQ1 xfail/77 warnings
167.72s. Root/scoped Ruff, changed format/whitespace, four hashes and every
old source/control/decorator AST PASS. Per retention <=2 intakes/4 views/
5 bounded history validators/12 digests/2 file checks; <=11 setup steps/
12 owner reads per synthetic case, never during retention. All four executed
positions spent; ignored `.git/returns-330-*` logs/hashes retained. No protected
studies/native/Arm/model/dependency/download/hardware work. Next separately
retained exact goal epoch/tick/delivery matching and closed publication;
missing/unsupported/nonfinite joins stay unknown without partial fields.

## 331. Exact Retained Native Goal Matching (2026-11-12)

Begin clean pushed31a8dd1. Add a separate bounded retained matcher, not
publication. Independently validate a four-key target with32-character epoch,
typed C1-range tick/delivery and two finite builtin uint32 goal words before
retained history. Require <=8 independently validated typed records and one
unique exact epoch/tick/delivery match, then exact stored-word correspondence.
Return a detached record; missing/ambiguous/unsupported/nonfinite/changed-word
targets reject explicitly without partial output. Equal numerical zeros with
different storage words remain unresolved, not normalized. All flags false;
no source/geometry/error/clock/one-use/physical/admission qualification follows.

Fresh15/60s, necessary repair15/60s reserve, root/360s. First15 PASS4.02s, no
failure/repair; root PASS5329, known QDQ1 xfail/77 warnings188.07s. Root/scoped
Ruff, changed format/whitespace, four hashes and every old source/control/
decorator AST PASS. <=8 retained candidates/9 packet validations, one detached
result; one actual setup capture/intake, no replay/draw/trig/clock/geometry in
matching. Typed targets, empty/oversized/nonlist histories, exact epoch/tick/
delivery, ambiguity, raw unknown words, zero storage ties and detached false
flags are covered. Both executed positions spent; unused repair is not
refunded authority. Ignored `.git/returns-331-*` logs/hashes retained, no
protected/native/Arm/model/dependency/download/hardware work. Next separately
closed default-off goal publication from delivered/pending bindings, preserving
original/closing owner/native/RNG/profile/pose/input/history/stored-word joins
and explicit unknown without partial fields.

## 332. Closed Default-Off Native Goal Delivery (2026-11-12)

Begin pushed5b0b7cb with retained matching complete; resumed untested local
publication work preserved. Reverify main/upstream0/0, Python3.12.3 at
/opt/venv, Ruff0.17.0, timeout and365GiB free. Add independent literal
default-off delivered-goal publication. Disabled work returns explicit unknown
without reads/payload; enabled work prevalidates <=8 retained raw records,
joins actual encoded State frame and exact stored goal words, and closes
original/closing owner/cache/native/RNG/profile/pose/input/history/dynamics/
source-file/output correspondence. Unsupported or missing correspondence is
explicit unknown without epoch/tick/frame/goal fields. All eight flags false.

Frozen C1 has zero odometry latency: this supports delivered-only latency0,
not a new pending profile. Positive latency is explicit unsupported domain;
no accepted profile/interface/noise/numerical/physical/clock/execution/one-use/
source/admission requirement changed. State has three goal components; the
unchanged encoder binds all three, and its planar first two float32 words
match retained storage. No replay/step/read-environment/RNG/trig/clock/geometry
work in publication.

Fresh20/60s, necessary20/60s repair reserve, root/360s. First19 PASS/1 FAIL
4.74s: publication incorrectly expected a two-component State goal. Source
repair validates actual three-component planar shape and extracts its first
two words; valid mismatch fixture and work instrumentation added. Repair19
PASS/1 FAIL5.41s: new file-check wrapper passed self to the existing static
helper, causing early unknowns. Necessary fixture-only revised20/60s:
20 PASS4.14s; assert closing branches reached, two views/matches/file checks
and unchanged <=12 digest cap. Three fresh required controls/60s verify missing
current/dynamics and a closing producer mutation of same-list history:
3 PASS3.55s after moving the last producer observation before owner closure.
No unchanged green20 rerun. Root PASS5352, known QDQ1 xfail/77 warnings
171.08s. Root/scoped Ruff, changed format/whitespace, four hashes, every prior
source/control/decorator AST and scoped local references PASS;
Pylance confirms State.goal_m tuple[float,float,float]. All executed positions
remain spent; ignored `.git/returns-332-*` logs/hashes retained. No protected/
native/Arm/model/dependency/download/hardware work. Pending domain remains a
separate prerequisite, not permission to alter C1. Next bounded supplied-word
native goal delta discrepancies, preserving unsupported/nonfinite unknowns
and unresolved equal-value/different-word ties; no geometry/error adoption.

## 333. Supplied-Word Native Goal Delta Discrepancies (2026-11-12)

Begin clean pushed3a198b4. Add bounded supplied world-minus-used-position
residuals for two native goal axes. Preserve the supplied inferred float64/
int64/uint64 dtype and exact words; finite canonical operands prevalidate
before exact arithmetic. Validated <=64-bit integers use exact Fraction,
not the existing generic arithmetic value helper's float conversion. A bounded
six-line local diagnostic confirmed int64 max loses its original word through
that generic conversion; no helper/producer/interface semantics changed.
The comparison is the unrounded preserved input difference versus observed
delta, including any conversion discrepancy, not a NumPy coercion/rounding law.
Observed infinity returns explicit unknown residual while retaining raw words
and finite exact difference; unsupported/NaN inputs reject without mutation.
Zero signs remain raw words, not normalized or numerically qualified.

Fresh24/60s, necessary repair24/60s reserve, root/360s. First23 PASS/1 FAIL4.88s:
the eight-bit exhausted-budget fixture used small exact integers which fit.
Fixture-only repair supplies canonical0.1; only that necessary case ran:
1 PASS3.82s, unchanged green23 not repeated. Root PASS5376, known QDQ1 xfail/
77 warnings172.68s; root Ruff PASS, format check FAIL only for Ruff-required
parentheses around0.1.hex(). Formatter-only repair preserves the tested AST
exactly; changed format/whitespace PASS, no green semantic/root Ruff rerun.
Four before hashes PASS; final hashes retained. Every prior source/control/
decorator AST and scoped references PASS. <=2 entries/6 word decodes/
4 binary operations/6 value conversions, <=4096 arithmetic bits. Integer
extremes, subnormal/nonzero residuals, overflow, signed zero, malformed dtype/
words/shape/types and literal permission/work budgets are covered. Executed
positions remain spent; ignored `.git/returns-333-*` logs/hashes retained.
No replay/RNG/trig/clock/geometry/source/numerical/error/physical/one-use/
admission adoption, all eight flags false; no protected/native/Arm/model/
dependency/download/hardware work. Next matched retained native goal delta
reports with original/closing typed source/operand/output joins. Archive
whole321-325 before further root review growth.

## 334. Intact Native Goal Prerequisite Checkpoint Archival (2026-11-12)

Begin clean pushedc64cbce. Before further review growth, move whole321-325
to [their archive][chapter-review-29], preserving byte-exact bodies/headings/separators, failures,
approvals, spent ledgers and historical next-action wording. Five root heading
anchors remain archive links; four live chapter03 checkpoint references
rebase, and section322's existing311-315 archive label is copied relative to
the new archive. Historical requirements/limits/authority are unchanged.

One fresh mechanical migration/30s PASS, no failure or repair; exact retained
block/prior headings, eleven scoped local links/anchors, whitespace and all
four tested source hashes PASS. Root816 lines before this note; archive163.
No code changes or green code/native/Arm/sanitizer rerun, new studies/models/
dependencies/downloads/hardware work or qualification adoption. Local before
snapshots and bounded migration utility retained in session files; portable
evidence remains committed documents. Next original/closing matched retained
native goal delta reports without replay, extra draws, law/bound adoption or
qualification shortcuts.

## 335. Matched Native Goal Delta Reports WIP and Pause (2026-11-12)

Begin clean pusheda165ac5. Add literal default-off
`include_goal_delta_residuals`, requiring goal computation inclusion. Delivered
reports reuse independently validated retained world/used-position/delta
words, retain exact source epoch/tick/delivery labels, and close original/
closing source/operand/report/output joins before publication. No new pending
domain, replay/draw/trig/clock/geometry/law/bound or qualification adoption;
all eight flags false. This implementation is WIP, not a completed root gate.

Fresh26/60s, necessary repair26/60s reserve, root/360s. One no-write patch
context miss was repaired before execution. Focused26 PASS4.29s/4453 deselected:
reuse23 delta-mode publication cases plus3 literal/dependency/outgoing-report
controls; unchanged plain-mode controls await required root regression.
<=2 reports/4 entries/12 word decodes/12 value conversions/8 binary operations,
unchanged <=2 intakes/views/matches/file checks and <=12 binding digests.
Pylance before/after found no resolved dynamic callers, not static compatibility
proof.

The user explicitly paused during the root run; stop the owned process
immediately. Partial log ends during pytest progress at85%, without a full
result or subsequent style gate. The root position is spent/aborted, not passed
or refunded. Last completed root remains5376, known QDQ1 xfail/77 warnings
from§333. Retain `.git/returns-335-*` logs/hashes and local WIP; the subsequent
explicit user request authorizes a WIP commit and pause, not another code run
or implementation slice. Scoped WIP whitespace/four tested hashes and every
unrelated source/control/decorator AST pass; no code gate is rerun. Next only
after a fresh actual continuation request:
revalidate the retained worktree/environment and finish the necessary bounded
root/style/conservation gate without repeating unchanged green focused controls.
No new source qualification, protected study/model/dependency/download/hardware
work, or numerical/physical/clock/execution/one-use/admission evidence.
